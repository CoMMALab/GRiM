"""Root build shim for grim's pybind11 Runner extension.

All project metadata lives in pyproject.toml; this file exists only to declare
the C++ extension (setuptools has no pyproject-native way to declare a pybind11
Extension). Most of the package is pure Python — the codegen toolkit plus the
runtime wrapper's cache management + nvcc invocation at register_robot time.
The _core extension is a small shim that dlopens the per-robot .so (built at
register_robot time) and dispatches numpy<->ctypes-friendly calls to it.

Building this extension at pip-install time requires only a C++17 compiler.
nvcc is NOT needed for `pip install -e .` — it comes into play only later, when
the user calls register_robot().
