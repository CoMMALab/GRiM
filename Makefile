# GRiM developer entry points (N2.3 ergonomics, 2026-09-08).
#
# The one rule this file exists to enforce: the checked-in generated regions
# (wrapper_template.cu C-ABI bodies + _core.cpp pybind bodies, both driven by
# grim_codegen/abi_specs.py) MUST be regenerated before _core is rebuilt —
# a stale _core after a table edit fails silently at runtime, not at build.
# `make build` therefore depends on `make gen`.
#
# Everything here is a thin veneer over the real commands (printed as it runs)
# so the underlying invocations stay copy-pasteable.
