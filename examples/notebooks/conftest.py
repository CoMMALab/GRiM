"""Collection-level skip guards for the example-notebook smoke tests.

The notebooks under ``examples/notebooks/`` double as CI smoke tests: they are executed
end-to-end via ``pytest --nbval-lax examples/notebooks/`` and validate numbers in-cell
(asserts against ``RBDReference`` / closed-form checks), so a green run == passing
docs. They require a real CUDA GPU + ``nvcc`` on PATH + ``grim`` installed —
the same triad as the python-wrapper smokes. nbval is required to collect ``.ipynb``
files as tests; if it's absent the notebooks are skipped (so a plain ``pytest``
without the dev extras doesn't error).

This conftest applies the ``notebooks`` marker to every collected ``.ipynb`` and
skips the whole directory when the preconditions aren't met. Per-notebook optional
deps (torch) are guarded inside the notebook's own preamble cell.
