GRiM documentation
==================

`GRiM <https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GRiD>`_ turns a URDF into optimized,
per-robot CUDA C++ for dynamics, kinematics, and collisions, with **analytical
derivatives and Hessians** for supported numerical operations and a
trajectory-optimization plant layer. Numerical Python interfaces include a numpy handle, a
``jax.jit``-able FFI surface, or ``torch.autograd``-aware ops, all backed by
one content-addressed ``.so`` cache. It is the dynamics layer underneath
`GATO <http://a2r-lab.org/GATO/>`_, `MPCGPU <https://a2r-lab.org/publication/mpcgpu/>`_,
`HJCD-IK <https://a2r-lab.org/publication/hjcdik/>`_ and other A2R Lab GPU
solvers, built on `GLASS <http://a2r-lab.org/GLASS/>`_ (block-local linear
algebra), `RBDReference <https://github.com/A2R-Lab/RBDReference>`_ (the
Pinocchio-validated numpy oracle every kernel is tested against) and
`URDFParser <https://github.com/A2R-Lab/URDFParser>`_.

Collision routines use the generated CUDA interface; see
:doc:`the collision workflow <user_guide/tutorials/collisions>` for geometry
coverage and integration. Start with the installation guide and examples below,
or visit the `project homepage <../>`_ for an overview.

**One block per problem, batched.** Every algorithm runs as a single CUDA
block per sample with in-block parallelism, so a batch of 16 or 4096 states
is the same kernel design on a Jetson or an RTX 5090 — no multi-block
reductions, no cooperative groups, bit-deterministic and thread-count
invariant. Artifacts are built per target architecture (``sm_XX``); the
model, the API and the generated code carry over, the binary does not.

   :gutter: 3

   .. grid-item-card:: numpy
      :link: user_guide/tutorials/python_wrappers
      :link-type: doc

      ``load_robot(urdf)`` → a handle with 20+ batched methods; inputs and
      outputs are host arrays, batched on axis 0.

   .. grid-item-card:: JAX
      :link: jax-ffi-quickstart
      :link-type: ref

      ``backend="jax"`` → device-in / device-out FFI targets that compose
      under ``jit``, ``vmap`` and ``scan``; ``jax.grad`` runs the analytical
      gradient kernels, never finite differences.

   .. grid-item-card:: torch
      :link: user_guide/tutorials/python_wrappers
      :link-type: doc

      ``backend="torch"`` → autograd-aware ops on the current CUDA stream,
      plus CUDA-graph capture for fixed-batch replay.

Complete, copy-paste examples for each surface are in the
:ref:`quickstart <landing-quickstart>` below.

What you get per robot
----------------------

* **Dynamics**: inverse dynamics (RNEA), forward dynamics (Minv-based and
  ABA), the joint-space inertia matrix (CRBA) and its inverse, gravity,
  non-linear effects, the Coriolis matrix, external body wrenches and tool
  loads.
* **Derivatives**: analytical gradients of inverse and forward dynamics
  (IDSVA / FDSVA), their **second-order** tensors, inverse-dynamics and
  forward-dynamics gradients with respect to the inertial parameters, and
  end-effector pose Jacobians and Hessians.
* **Kinematics and centroidal quantities**: end-effector poses (baked or
  runtime targets), frame Jacobians and their time derivatives, centroidal
  momentum matrix, its time variation and the operational-space inertia.
* **Plant layer**: integrators with gradients, quadratic and barrier costs
  with gradients and Hessians, ready for a trajectory optimizer.
* **Collisions**: self- and environment-collision checks with covering-sphere
  or native-primitive representations and coarse-to-fine evaluation in CUDA.
* **Conventions**: Pinocchio by default; MuJoCo/mjx-convention twins of
  values and derivatives on floating-base robots (``handle.mujoco.<op>``).

The test suites compare generated CUDA with CPU references and record GPU
results in signed receipts. See :doc:`validation <user_guide/tutorials/cuda_validation>`
for the test workflow and :doc:`backend coverage <user_guide/tutorials/backend_coverage>`
for operation-specific support.

Performance and release measurements
------------------------------------------------------------

The :doc:`release measurements <release_measurements>` page holds one audited
collection — three robots, fifteen operations, batches 16 to 1024, GRiM through
every surface beside Pinocchio, MJX, MuJoCo Warp, MuJoCo CPU, BARD and Frax —
with the protocol, every cell's validation status and the cases GRiM loses.
The :doc:`benchmarks page <user_guide/tutorials/benchmarks>` retains dated
development experiments and harness guidance; those results are not release
evidence.

Portable by construction
------------------------

The generated code adapts to the device it runs on rather than to the one it
was tuned on: a per-algorithm **resource tier** chooses how much of the
working set lives in shared memory (``SHARED`` for peak performance,
``LITE`` and ``MINIMAL`` rungs that spill scratch to global memory so the
largest humanoids still fit a 48 KB budget), launch configurations are
autotuned per robot and architecture, and a **runtime context** carries the device arena, streams
and model tables — several isolated pipelines can share one GPU, one handle
can swap inertial parameters at run time, and autograd refuses to
differentiate a model that changed under it. GRiM targets a single GPU, from
embedded Jetson-class devices to desktop cards, one artifact per
architecture; the tested deployment platform of this release is Linux x86_64
(see :doc:`compatibility and known limitations <user_guide/getting_started/compatibility>`).

Quickstart
----------

Install from a recursive clone (editable install; the extras pin the CPU jax
/ torch packages, so add the CUDA wheels yourself — see
:doc:`installation <user_guide/getting_started/installation>`):

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GRiD && cd GRiM
   bash install/base_install.sh && source .venv/bin/activate
   pip install -e ".[jax,torch]" "jax[cuda12]"      # optional: the JAX and torch surfaces

Each example below runs as written from the repository root. The **first**
``load_robot`` of a robot generates and compiles its ``.so`` — about ten
minutes for the 7-DoF iiwa14 on an RTX 5090, an hour for a humanoid (the dated
cold/warm table and the RAM-safe subset builds are on
:doc:`fast robot setup <user_guide/getting_started/fast_robot_setup>`).
Every later load is seconds: the artifact is cached by content key and rebuilt
only when the URDF, the options, the GRiM version or the toolchain change.
