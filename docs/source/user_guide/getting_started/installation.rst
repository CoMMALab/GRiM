Installation
============

GRiM is a single repository with its peer products (``GLASS``, ``RBDReference``,
``URDFParser``) vendored as git submodules under ``external/``. Clone with
``--recursive`` so those populate, then run the install script — a single
``pip install -e .`` installs the codegen toolkit and the ``grim`` Python
wrapper together (see the :doc:`../../index` quick-start for the extras).

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GRiD.git
    cd GRiM

If you already cloned without ``--recursive``, populate the submodules with
``git submodule update --init --recursive``.

Source installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use an **editable install from a Git checkout**. The generator, wrapper
template, launch profiles, GLASS headers and model assets are resolved
relative to the repository root, so keep the checkout in place. ``main`` is
the branch documented here.

What each activity needs:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 34 66

   * - Activity
     - Requirements
   * - Import ``grim_codegen`` / generate ``grim.cuh``
     - Python ≥ 3.10, the ``external/`` submodules populated. No GPU, no
       ``nvcc``.
   * - ``grim.register_robot`` / ``warm_robot`` (first call per robot)
     - the CUDA Toolkit's ``nvcc`` on ``PATH`` (the toolkit that matches your
       driver), a host C++ compiler, and an NVIDIA GPU present (the compute
       capability is read from ``nvidia-smi`` unless you pass ``cuda_arch=``).
   * - Warm loads and every numeric method
     - a GPU with the arch the ``.so`` was built for; no ``nvcc``.
   * - ``backend="jax"`` / ``backend="torch"``
     - the ``[jax]`` / ``[torch]`` extra **plus a CUDA build of that framework
       matching your GPU arch** (the extras pin the CPU packages only; the
       CUDA wheel is your choice, e.g. ``pip install "jax[cuda12]"`` or
       ``"jax[cuda13]"``, and a ``cu1xx`` torch wheel — see the
       `bindings README <https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GRiD/blob/main/bindings/README.md>`_).
       A missing framework, or a CPU-only jax, is reported at
       ``register_robot`` time, not deep inside a call.
   * - Equivalence tests / the Pinocchio oracle / docs
     - ``install/developer_install.sh`` (apt build deps, ``pin``,
       robot-description fixtures, the Pinocchio second-order extension).

Platform: Linux x86_64 with CUDA 12.x/13.x is what is built and tested
(the committed GPU-proof receipt names the exact GPU and toolkit). Windows
and macOS are not supported. The submodules
must be populated before the first **generation** (not before the editable
install itself): ``install/base_install.sh`` runs ``pip install -e .`` and
then ``git submodule update --init --recursive``; a bare editable install on
a non-recursive clone succeeds and then fails at first generation with a
"GLASS submodule is missing" error naming the fix.

Install Python Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The simplest path is to use the provided install scripts, which create a
local ``.venv`` and register the ``grim-generate`` CLI.

For end-user installs (just the runtime + CLI):

.. code-block:: shell

   bash install/base_install.sh
   source .venv/bin/activate

For developer installs (adds Pinocchio, robot-description fixtures,
documentation tooling, and the Pinocchio second-order pybind11 extension
used as the golden oracle in the equivalence tests):

.. code-block:: shell

   bash install/developer_install.sh

The developer script will, on Debian/Ubuntu, install the system build
deps needed by the Pinocchio pybind11 extension via ``apt-get``:
``pkg-config``, ``g++``, ``libeigen3-dev``, ``liburdfdom-headers-dev``.
The ``pin`` wheel ships its own ``pinocchio.pc`` inside the venv via
``cmeel``, and ``install/developer_install.sh`` computes the right
``PKG_CONFIG_PATH`` automatically for the extension build — no manual
configuration is required.

You can also install manually with:

.. code-block:: shell

   pip3 install -e .

Install CUDA Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get -y install xorg xorg-dev linux-headers-$(uname -r) apt-transport-https

Download and Install CUDA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note: the commands below are for Ubuntu 24.04 (``ubuntu2404``) —
substitute your release in the repo URL, and see
https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads for other distros. NVIDIA's
repos now use the ``cuda-keyring`` package (the old ``apt-key`` method
was removed in Ubuntu 22.04+):

::

   wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2404/x86_64/cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
   sudo dpkg -i cuda-keyring_1.1-1_all.deb
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get -y install cuda-toolkit

Add the following to ``~/.bashrc``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

::

   export PATH="/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH"
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH="/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
   export PATH="/opt/nvidia/nsight-compute/:$PATH"

.. note::

    GRiM requires a C++17-capable host compiler (e.g. ``g++ >= 7`` or
    ``clang++ >= 5``). The benchmark and codegen runtime compile with
    ``-std=c++17``, needed for inline variables in the bench common
    header. With the ``[torch]`` extra the per-robot ``.so`` is compiled
    with whatever standard the installed torch's ATen headers demand
    (``-std=c++20`` from torch 2.14 on, detected from the header guard), so
    a torch-enabled build needs an nvcc and host compiler that accept C++20
    (CUDA 12+, ``g++ >= 10``). ``GRIM_CXX_STD`` forces the standard.
