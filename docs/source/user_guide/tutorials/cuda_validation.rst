CUDA Validation And Performance Reporting
=========================================

This page summarizes the developer CUDA validation flow for generated GRiM
headers. The checks are intentionally staged so long GPU runs provide useful
progress and can be resumed with cached generated artifacts.

Local Docs Build
----------------

Developer installs include the Sphinx documentation dependencies. To install
them manually in an existing environment:

.. code-block:: bash

   .venv/bin/python -m pip install -r docs/requirements.txt

Build the HTML docs from the repository root:

.. code-block:: bash

   .venv/bin/python -m sphinx -W --keep-going -b html docs/source docs/build/html

CUDA Correctness Checks (crash-isolated split driver)
-----------------------------------------------------

The full GPU pass runs through the crash-isolated split driver, which partitions
the ``cuda_equivalence`` and ``python_wrappers`` suites into bounded shards (one
module's abort can't eat the rest) and is pausable/resumable:

.. code-block:: bash

   # everything, sharded + receipt-signed (the standard full pass):
   SPLIT=1 test/run_gpu_proof.sh

   # only the shards whose inputs changed vs the committed receipt:
   SPLIT=1 SPLIT_REFRESH=1 test/run_gpu_proof.sh

   # the driver directly (no receipt), e.g. wrappers only:
   .venv/bin/python test/run_split_suite.py --domains wrappers
   .venv/bin/python test/run_split_suite.py --domains wrappers,cuda --changed-only

``touch <out>/PAUSE`` stops cleanly between shards; ``--resume <out>`` continues
an interrupted run without re-running completed shards. See ``CLAUDE.md`` and
``test/run_split_suite.py --help`` for the full contract (RAM-aware compile
pool, shard bin-packing, receipt merge/carry).

For a quick targeted check, plain pytest still works:

.. code-block:: bash

   .venv/bin/python -m pytest -m cuda_equivalence -q   # CUDA vs numpy oracle
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest -m python_wrappers -q    # jax/torch handles

(The retired ``run_staged_cuda_checks.py`` stage runner predates the split
driver; its stages map onto the shard partition + ``--changed-only``.)

GPU-Proof Signed Receipts
-------------------------

Because the CUDA equivalence suite needs a real GPU (and a full cold run is
hours), GRiM records correctness in a *signed receipt* so a merge can be gated
CPU-only, without re-running GPU tests in CI. This uses the ``pytest-gpu-proof``
plugin, installed from PyPI via ``requirements-dev.txt`` (it was previously a
vendored ``test/pytest-gpu-proof`` submodule):

.. code-block:: bash

   .venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt   # brings in pytest-gpu-proof

Generate the receipt on a quiet GPU box. The scope is tiered so it is never an
all-or-nothing barrier — the signature, code fingerprint, and commit-SHA proof
are identical regardless of how many tests the receipt attests:

.. code-block:: bash

   SCOPE=smoke   test/run_gpu_proof.sh   # ~2 robots, cached cells — minutes; proves the plumbing
   SCOPE=curated test/run_gpu_proof.sh   # representative robot set — tens of minutes
   SCOPE=full    test/run_gpu_proof.sh   # every gpu_proof test — hours cold, the nightly job (default)

The ``gpu_proof`` marker is auto-applied to every ``cuda_equivalence`` and
``python_wrappers`` item by ``test/conftest.py`` (no per-test annotation), so
receipt membership tracks the existing marker taxonomy. Running the script signs
``gpu-proof.json`` in place with your local SSH key and refuses a dirty tree
(``allow_dirty:false`` in ``test/gpu-proof-policy.yaml``): the fingerprint cannot
descend into the codegen/GLASS submodules, so a clean tree is what makes the
receipt's commit SHA an honest pin of the code under test.

CI (``.github/workflows/verify-gpu-proof.yml``) verifies whatever receipt is
committed — signature (via ``github.com/{signer}.keys``), fingerprint, commit
SHA, freshness — with no GPU and no secrets, and **skips gracefully when no
receipt is present** so code can ship before the long GPU run lands. A second
always-on CPU lane runs the no-GPU tests (descriptor parity, kernel-attr
manifest, plant launch hygiene).

The two-tier receipt policy (when CI goes red, and the fix)
-----------------------------------------------------------

The committed ``gpu-proof.json`` goes stale — and CI's verify-receipt job goes
RED — the moment a push touches a fingerprinted test file (anything under
``test/cuda_equivalents/`` or ``test/python_wrappers/``). **That red is by
design**; the fix is a refresh, not a revert:

- **Everyday** (``test/gpu-proof-policy.yaml``, ``allow_carried: true``):
  ``SPLIT=1 SPLIT_REFRESH=1 test/run_gpu_proof.sh`` re-runs ONLY the shards
  whose narrow fingerprints changed vs the committed receipt and CARRIES the
  rest; commit the refreshed receipt and CI goes green — minutes-to-hours,
  not a full pass. A carried shard attests "these tests, whose files are
  unchanged, passed at an ancestor commit ≤30 days old"; cross-cutting
  codegen/bindings changes are NOT re-proven by carry.
  ``GRIM_SPLIT_REFRESH_DRY=1`` previews the stale/carried plan (clean tree
  required).
- **Release** (``test/gpu-proof-policy-release.yaml``,
  ``allow_carried: false``): refuses carried shards outright — a release
  receipt requires ONE fresh full ``SPLIT=1`` pass at the release tip.
  Verify with ``--policy test/gpu-proof-policy-release.yaml``.

Maintainer internals: stale shard NAMES are recycled into the fresh partition
automatically (the carry contract has no "superseded" state); a deleted test
module forces a full pass; and both compile caches are CONTENT-keyed
(header/source bytes), so byte-identical codegen edits cost seconds of
regeneration, never an nvcc rebuild. Two newer carry gates: the per-shard
**header-key replay** (``test/header_key_replay.py``, records in
``test/gpu-proof-header-keys.json``) byte-precisely re-checks that each
carried shard's generated headers regenerate identically; and the
**robot-asset gate** (``codegen_neutrality.changed_robot_assets``) demotes
the covering shards when an oracle-side robot asset changes. Related lesson:
every emission-shaping env var must be folded into the header cache key —
``GRIM_ENABLE_MUJOCO_KERNELS`` once changed emission without changing the
key and served stale headers.

The full test-pyramid rationale (which suite exists for what, and why the
receipt is trustworthy) lives in ``test/TESTING_STRATEGY.md``; a bucket map of
everything in ``test/``'s root is ``test/README.md``.

CUDA Artifact Cache
-------------------

The CUDA equivalence tests cache both generated headers and compiled runners.
This avoids regenerating and recompiling the same robot/configuration between
test stages.

Environment variables:

* ``GRIM_CUDA_CACHE_DIR=.grim_build_cache/cuda`` controls the cache root.
* ``GRIM_CUDA_DISABLE_CACHE=1`` disables header and runner reuse.
* ``GRIM_CUDA_VERBOSE_CACHE=1`` prints cache hit/miss details.
* ``GRIM_CUDA_ARCH=120`` overrides architecture detection when needed.

The header cache key includes robot identity, base mode, codegen source hash,
target shared-memory bytes, profile/algorithm selection, and cache schema
version. The runner cache key also includes CUDA architecture, ``nvcc`` version,
L2 mode, compile flags, and runner source hash.

Progress Output
---------------

CUDA equivalence tests print live progress through pytest's terminal reporter.
This keeps long GPU runs from looking stuck under normal pytest capture.

Environment variables:

* ``GRIM_CUDA_PROGRESS=0`` disables progress output.
* ``GRIM_CUDA_VERBOSE_PROGRESS=1`` enables per-algorithm detail.
* ``GRIM_CUDA_VERBOSE_CACHE=1`` includes cache details in progress output.

Sample Selection
----------------

Use ``GRIM_CUDA_SAMPLE_NAMES`` to choose deterministic samples:

.. code-block:: bash

   GRIM_CUDA_RANDOM_SAMPLES=0 \
   GRIM_CUDA_SAMPLE_NAMES=zero,positive,negative,mixed_sign,tiny \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest test/cuda_equivalents/test_cuda_executable_equivalence.py -q -s

Recognized deterministic sample names include:

* ``zero``
* ``positive``
* ``negative``
* ``mixed_sign``
* ``tiny``
* ``velocity_only``
* ``accel_or_torque_only``
* ``near_limit``
* ``floating_quat_identity``
* ``floating_quat_positive``
* ``floating_quat_mixed``

Set ``GRIM_CUDA_SAMPLE_NAMES=all`` to include all deterministic corner samples.
Set ``GRIM_CUDA_RANDOM_SAMPLES=N`` to append ``N`` seeded random samples.

Shared-Memory And L2 Controls
-----------------------------

Generated CUDA kernels use target-aware shared-memory tiers. The generator keeps
the most shared-memory-heavy, all-shared implementation when it fits, and only
selects spill tiers when the generated dynamic-shared arena exceeds the target
byte budget. The current default target is ``98304`` bytes (96 KiB), which
matches the opt-in dynamic shared-memory size available on many CUDA GPUs.

Use ``GRIM_CUDA_TARGET_SHARED_MEM_BYTES`` at code-generation time to choose a
different target:

.. code-block:: bash

   # More portable target; useful for testing low-shared-memory fallback paths.
   GRIM_CUDA_TARGET_SHARED_MEM_BYTES=49152 grim-generate path/to/robot.urdf

   # Current default: prefer all-shared kernels up to 96 KiB.
   GRIM_CUDA_TARGET_SHARED_MEM_BYTES=98304 grim-generate path/to/robot.urdf

   # Experimental only: use a larger target if the deployment GPU supports it.
   GRIM_CUDA_TARGET_SHARED_MEM_BYTES=120000 grim-generate path/to/robot.urdf

At runtime, generated host initialization checks the actual device's per-block
shared-memory limit, including CUDA's opt-in limit when available, and reports a
clear launch/configuration error if the generated request is too large for the
device.

Useful environment variables for fallback testing:

* ``GRIM_CUDA_TARGET_SHARED_MEM_BYTES=10000`` forces low-target fallback paths.
* ``GRIM_CUDA_ENABLE_L2_PERSISTING=1`` opts back in to the persisting-L2 hint.
  The generated default is now ``0``: a controlled A/B measured the pin never
  helping and hurting by up to 23%. The harness forwards the env var to the
  compile as ``-DGRIM_CUDA_ENABLE_L2_PERSISTING=<n>``.
* ``GRIM_CUDA_FORCE_SHARED_TIER=GRIM_SPILL_DA_DF_OUTPUT`` forces a gradient
  shared-memory tier when generated support is available.

The shared-memory target is a legality and first-pass performance heuristic, not
a full occupancy model. It does not currently account for register pressure,
instruction-cache effects, or topology-specific compiler behavior. For example,
on one robot a 96 KiB all-shared tier may be fastest, while on another robot a
selective-spill tier can win because it uses fewer registers or allows better
occupancy.

Register-Pressure And Tier Analysis
-----------------------------------

For performance work, compare a small set of generated variants on the target
GPU instead of assuming one target is best for every robot/topology. A practical
local sweep is:

1. Generate the same robot/profile with several shared-memory targets, usually
   ``49152``, ``98304``, and optionally the device's opt-in maximum.
2. Compile with ptxas verbosity enabled, for example by adding
   ``-Xptxas=-v`` to the compile command used for the timing binary.
3. Record ptxas output for each kernel: registers per thread, local memory, and
   any compiler-reported spills.
4. Run the generated timing kernels with GPU warmup and internal repeats.
5. Prefer the fastest correct tier on that GPU, while keeping the 96 KiB default
   for generated code that has not been locally tuned.

The non-failing performance reporter can capture ptxas lines and timing
summaries around an existing timing command:

.. code-block:: bash

   .venv/bin/python test/benchmarks/perf_regression_report.py \
     --robot g1 \
     --base-mode floating \
     --profile all \
     --fallback-tier auto \
     --precision float \
     -- ./path/to/generated_timing_binary

If the compile command emits ptxas lines, the report prints a ``ptxas summary``
section. Use this to look for tier choices that trade shared memory for
substantially higher register count or local-memory spills. Save baselines only
from stable, representative GPU machines:

.. code-block:: bash

   .venv/bin/python test/benchmarks/perf_regression_report.py \
     --robot g1 --base-mode floating --profile all \
     --fallback-tier GRIM_SPILL_DA_DF_OUTPUT --precision float --save \
     -- ./path/to/generated_timing_binary

Second-order diagnostics are opt-in:

.. code-block:: bash

   GRIM_CUDA_RUN_SECOND_ORDER_FALLBACK_SMOKE=1 \
   GRIM_CUDA_SECOND_ORDER_SMOKE_ROBOT=iiwa14 \
   .venv/bin/python -m pytest test/cuda_equivalents/test_cuda_second_order_fallback.py -q -s

Use ``GRIM_CUDA_SECOND_ORDER_TEST_THREADS`` to override the diagnostic runner's
thread count.

Linear Algebra Backend
----------------------

Generated headers include a GRiM-owned linear algebra backend adapter
that vendors the SIMT subset of `GLASS
<https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GLASS>`_ (``L1/dot``, ``L2/gemv``,
``L3/gemm``) at codegen time. Generated headers are self-contained — no
external SDK dependencies. The cuBLASDx-backed ``glass-nvidia`` path
was removed in v2.0; see :doc:`../concepts/cublasdx_removal_design`.

Performance Reporting
---------------------

Performance reports are informational and non-failing. They are intended for a
stable, fast GPU machine after correctness is green.

Run the standard benchmark suite with:

.. code-block:: bash

   .venv/bin/python test/benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py

or run one GRiM benchmark slice directly:

.. code-block:: bash

   .venv/bin/python test/benchmarks/baselines/grid/run.py \
     --robot g1 --base floating

Use ``test/benchmarks/perf_regression_report.py`` when you want a non-failing
delta report around a timing command or a local JSON baseline. The reporter
records:

* GPU name
* compute capability
* CUDA version
* robot
* fixed/floating base mode
* codegen profile
* fallback tier
* precision

It reports min, median or mean, max, spread, and percent delta from matching
JSON baselines. Use ``--save`` only when the run should become the local
baseline for that GPU class.
