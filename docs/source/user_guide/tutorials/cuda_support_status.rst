CUDA Support Status
===================

This page summarizes the generated CUDA paths that are currently exercised by
the GRiM developer test suite. For the commands that run these checks, see
:doc:`cuda_validation`.

Development testing currently targets **sm_120 (RTX 5090)** for correctness
and performance validation. Earlier compute capabilities (sm_8x) remain
supported but are not the active development target.

Joint and interface restrictions
--------------------------------

This is a coverage summary, not a guarantee for every combination of joint
type, algorithm, backend and GPU resource budget.

* Planar and translation joints are decomposed into scalar-joint chains by
  the parser; mimic joints retain dependent bodies but reduce coordinates.
* Mimic and spherical ``minv`` use a dense inverse of the reduced CRBA
  matrix rather than the scalar-joint direct-inverse recursion.
* ``fk_batched`` is a NumPy-only single-leaf pose helper. It is not emitted
  for spherical models or models with more than 32 joints.
* Multi-stage integrator gradients are not supported for spherical joints
  or MuJoCo-output twins. ``plant_step_hessian`` supports Euler and
  semi-implicit Euler on fixed and floating bases, via NumPy/CUDA rather
  than the JAX/PyTorch handles.

See :doc:`../concepts/algorithms/kinematics` and
:doc:`../concepts/algorithms/integrators_and_plant` for shapes and method scope.

Fixed-Base Robots
-----------------

Fixed-base CUDA coverage includes the core dynamics and kinematics paths:

* Inverse dynamics / RNEA, direct Minv, forward dynamics, ABA, and CRBA.
* Inverse- and forward-dynamics gradients.
* End-effector pose, gradient, and Hessian.
* Fixed-base forced-fallback coverage for oversized gradient kernels.
* IDSVA-SO (body-frame and world-frame variants) and FDSVA-SO. The dispatcher
  selects body-frame IDSVA-SO for fixed-base models.
* Optional per-body external forces (``d_f_ext``) on RNEA, forward
  dynamics, ABA, and the inverse-/forward-dynamics gradients (opt-in;
  ``nullptr`` reproduces the no-force path).
* The ``grim_plant`` layer (``plant_step``, quadratic state/input costs,
  end-effector position cost, and joint position/velocity/torque
  log-barriers), emitted as a sibling ``grim_plant`` namespace.
* The centroidal family and its derivatives: ``com``, ``ccrba``, ``energy``,
  ``dccrba`` (∂A/∂q tensor), and ``cmm_time_variation`` (Ȧ).
* The ``coriolis_matrix`` ``C(q,q̇)`` and the kinetic / potential
  inertial-parameter energy regressors.
* Runtime arbitrary multi-EE: ``end_effector_pose_runtime`` and
  ``end_effector_pose_gradient_runtime`` (runtime target joint id + per-target
  offset).
* Optional runtime-mutable inertial parameters (flag-gated ``d_inertia_params``
  + ``set_inertia_params``; the baked default is byte-identical).
* Arbitrary/skew joint ``<axis>`` (dense 6-vector ``S``) for
  ``inverse_dynamics`` and ``crba`` (stage 1; cardinal axes byte-identical).

Second-order fixed-base diagnostics are still developer-only. The current
green zero-sample set includes ``iiwa14``, ``go2``, ``gen3``, ``fr3``,
``fetch``, and ``rizon4`` (healed 2026-09-15: the upstream flexiv xacro
emitted each link's origin/mass/inertia triple bare, so the local
``config/robot_assets/rizon4.urdf`` now wraps them in proper ``<inertial>``
elements).

Floating-Base Robots
--------------------

Floating-base CUDA coverage includes:

* Inverse dynamics / RNEA.
* Direct Minv, forward dynamics, ABA, and CRBA.
* Inverse- and forward-dynamics gradients.
* End-effector pose.
* Opt-in end-effector pose gradient and Hessian checks.
* IDSVA-SO (world-frame variant, dispatcher-selected) and FDSVA-SO.
* The centroidal family ``com`` / ``ccrba`` / ``energy`` and the centroidal
  derivatives ``dccrba`` / ``cmm_time_variation``. The two derivatives also
  emit on big floating-base robots (e.g. ``g1`` / ``h1_2``-floating) via the
  sweep-pool spill path, so their prior big-floating gap is eliminated.

Floating end-effector Hessian generation uses target-aware spill tiers when
needed:

* Tier 0 keeps all Hessian scratch in shared memory.
* Tier 1 spills chained ``d2eeTemp`` scratch to ``d_workspace``.
* Tier 2 spills both d2XHom and ``d2eeTemp`` to ``d_workspace``.

Tier selection is generated from robot dimensions, base mode, topology-derived
transform counts, and ``GRIM_CUDA_TARGET_SHARED_MEM_BYTES``. It is not keyed on
robot fixture names.

Shared-Memory Fallbacks
-----------------------

Generated kernels prefer the all-shared path when it fits the target shared
memory budget. The default target is 96 KiB:

.. code-block:: bash

   GRIM_CUDA_TARGET_SHARED_MEM_BYTES=98304

Set a lower target to test fallback paths, or a higher target only when the
deployment GPU supports the requested dynamic shared memory. Runtime checks
compare generated requests against the actual device limit before launch.

Gradient fallback tiers keep the hot ``dv/*`` derivative intermediates in
shared memory first, then spill larger ``da/*`` and ``df/*`` buffers when the
full shared-memory path is oversized. The emergency tier spills more temporary
state to the generated workspace.

Known Caveats
-------------

* Floating IDSVA-SO/FDSVA-SO CUDA generation is now enabled (dispatcher
  picks ``idsva_so_world_frame`` for floating-base). FDSVA-SO on
  ``g1_floating`` requires the selective-spill tier under sm_120's
  ~100 KiB per-block dynamic shared-memory cap; the tier selector picks
  it automatically.
* Broad nonzero/random floating Hessian coverage is slower than the default
  smoke suite and remains opt-in.
* Compute Sanitizer should be run on a supported GPU/driver setup before
  treating fallback paths as fully sanitizer-clean.
* Performance tier choices can depend on register pressure and occupancy; use
  ptxas output and timing kernels on the target GPU before saving local
  baselines. Tiers are named ``TIER_SHARED`` (default) / ``TIER_LITE`` /
  ``TIER_MINIMAL`` (the old ``TIER_PERF`` alias has been removed — use
  ``TIER_SHARED``). See :doc:`../concepts/resource_tier_system`.
* Robots with **mimic joints**: non-gradient algorithms are supported, and
  **every** gradient now emits a correct mimic-reduced result on both bases —
  ``inverse_dynamics_gradient`` / ``forward_dynamics_gradient``,
  ``end_effector_pose_gradient`` / ``end_effector_pose_hessian``, the second-order
  ``idsva_so`` / ``fdsva_so``, the external-force gradients (``f_ext_gradient``),
  and the integrator gradients. No mimic gradient raises ``NotImplementedError``
  anymore. The centroidal kinematics family
  (``com`` / ``ccrba`` / ``energy``) and the centroidal derivatives
  (``dccrba`` / ``cmm_time_variation``) are now mimic-reduced as well: the
  per-body world Jacobian and per-unit motion columns carry the mimic
  multiplier (α), so all five emit + validate against the mimic-aware
  RBDReference oracle on fixed-base mimic robots.
* External-force **gradients**: ``f_ext_gradient``
  (∂τ/∂f_ext = −Jᵀ, ∂q̈/∂f_ext = M⁻¹Jᵀ) and the fixed-base ``f_ext_gradient_dq``
  (−∂Jᵀ/∂q), both with CUDA equivalence tests, and both now fold correctly to the
  reduced coordinates on mimic robots as well.

- General-frame geometric Jacobian for an arbitrary target frame in any of the three Pinocchio reference frames (``LOCAL``, ``WORLD``, ``LOCAL_WORLD_ALIGNED``). The numpy reference additionally provides the Jacobian time-variation J̇ and the operational-space (OSC) inertia Λ = (J·M⁻¹·Jᵀ)⁻¹ — all validated against Pinocchio's ``getFrameJacobian``/``getJointJacobian``, ``computeJointJacobiansTimeVariation``, and ``(J·M⁻¹·Jᵀ)⁻¹``. CUDA codegen emits all three as opt-in keys — J (``frame_jacobian``), J̇ (``frame_jacobian_dot``), and Λ (``osc_inertia``) — each validated on-device against the numpy reference across the three frames (Λ is self-contained: it composes M⁻¹ on-device). All three additionally have the full launchable surface (batched ``*_kernel`` + 3-mode host writing the ``grimData`` ``d_frame_jacobian`` / ``d_frame_jacobian_dot`` / ``d_osc_inertia`` buffers), so they are benchmarkable + bindable; the launchable surface bakes the leaf-EE target + ``LOCAL_WORLD_ALIGNED`` frame, while the ``*_device`` functions stay the arbitrary-target/-frame entry points
- Second-Order Inverse Dynamics (IDSVA-SO) from `Singh, Russell, & Wensing <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06001>`__ — the dispatcher selects body-frame for fixed-base and world-frame for floating-base models. See :doc:`../../release_measurements` for measured performance.
- Second-Order Forward Dynamics (FDSVA-SO) from `Singh, Russell, & Wensing <https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.06001>`__ on both fixed and floating bases
- A **time-integrator** family: the discrete step ``x_{k+1}`` plus its gradient ``∂x_{k+1}/∂(x,u)`` and a fused value-and-gradient variant
- Optional per-body **external forces** (``f_ext``), threaded through RNEA, forward dynamics, ABA, and the inverse-/forward-dynamics gradients. Opt-in (a ``nullptr``/empty default reproduces the no-force path exactly), supplied in the body-local frame (``6*NUM_BODIES``, body-major) and subtracted from the per-body force.
- **External-force gradients**: ``∂tau/∂f_ext = -Jᵀ`` and ``∂q̈/∂f_ext = M⁻¹Jᵀ``, plus the fixed-base ``∂(inverse_dynamics_gradient)/∂f_ext = -∂Jᵀ/∂q``
- A trajectory-optimization-oriented **``grim_plant`` layer** (emitted as a sibling ``grim_plant`` namespace): a ``plant_step`` integrator wrapper, quadratic state/input costs, an end-effector position cost (with Gauss-Newton Hessian), and joint position/velocity/torque log-barriers.
- The **Coriolis matrix** ``C(q,q̇)`` (with ``C·q̇ + g(q) = nonlinear_effects``)
- **Inertial-parameter energy regressors**: kinetic ``y_KE`` and potential ``y_PE`` (each length ``10·NB``, with ``KE = y_KE·π`` and ``PE = y_PE·π``)
- The **centroidal derivatives**: ``dccrba`` (the ∂A/∂q tensor, 6×NV×NV) and ``cmm_time_variation`` (the centroidal-momentum-matrix time variation Ȧ)
- **Runtime arbitrary multi-EE pose / pose-gradient** (``end_effector_pose_runtime`` + ``_gradient``): the end-effector target joint id and a per-target offset become runtime arguments instead of codegen-baked, so one compiled robot serves any leaf/target frame.
- **Runtime-mutable inertial parameters** (flag-gated): a ``set_inertia_params`` device entry mutates an on-device parameter table (sysID / domain randomization) with no recompile; the baked default path is byte-identical.
- The **joint-torque inertial-parameter regressor** (``inverse_dynamics_regressor``): the classic ``Y(q, q̇, q̈)`` with ``tau = Y·π``
- The **analytic regressor gradient** (``inverse_dynamics_regressor_gradient``): ∂Y/∂q and ∂Y/∂q̇, satisfying the contraction identity ``dY_dx[c]·π == ∂τ/∂x[:,c]``
- The **forward-dynamics parameter gradient** (``forward_dynamics_parameter_gradient``): ``∂q̈/∂π = −M⁻¹Y``
- **Contact-frame wrench mapping** (``f_ext_contact``): maps a contact-frame wrench to the joint-local ``f_ext`` layout, with the ``∂/∂f_c`` and ``∂/∂q`` derivatives
- **Runtime multi-target positions** (``multi_target_position`` / ``multi_target_position_gradient``): batched runtime-target position queries and their gradients
