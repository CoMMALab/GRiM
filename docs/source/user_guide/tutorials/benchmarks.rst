Benchmarks
==========

.. warning::

   This page includes dated development measurements, not the release
   benchmark. Some historical reports compare different timing boundaries or
   model variants; do not reuse their speedups as headlines. The audited
   release collection is on the :doc:`release measurements <../../release_measurements>`
   page.

GRiM ships a benchmark harness that compares GRiM against CPU and GPU
baselines (Pinocchio, MJX, Frax, BARD) and against historical GRiM
reference points. BARD (PyTorch) is timed on both torch CPU and CUDA, so
it contributes ``bard_cpu`` / ``bard_gpu`` columns to the report. The
harness lives under
`test/benchmarks/ <https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GRiD/tree/main/test/benchmarks>`_.

Quick start
-----------

The full multi-baseline sweep:

.. code-block:: shell

   .venv/bin/python test/benchmarks/run_benchmarks.py

A single GRiM cell for fast iteration (per-exe path: one TU / exe /
process per algorithm, RAM-safe and crash-isolated):

.. code-block:: shell

   .venv/bin/python test/benchmarks/per_algo_bench.py --robot iiwa14 --base fixed

A multi-version comparison sweep (multiple GRiM configurations + baselines)
producing the canonical markdown report:

.. code-block:: shell

   .venv/bin/python test/benchmarks/run_multi_version.py \
       --columns glass --robots iiwa14 go2 g1 --bases fixed floating \
       --single-call-iters 50000 --batch-iters 500 \
       --output-dir test/benchmarks/results/comparison_<tag> \
       --report test/benchmarks/benchmark_multi_version_<tag>.md

The full sweep takes ~1.5 hours on an RTX 5090. cuBLASDx (``glass_nvidia``)
was removed in v2.0 of the codegen; see
:doc:`../concepts/cublasdx_removal_design` for the rationale and the
``archive/last-cublasdx`` git tag for the historical comparison data.

Algorithms measured
-------------------

The bench reports 13 rows per cell:

**First-order set (10 algorithms)**:

* ``inverse_dynamics`` — inverse dynamics (RNEA).
* ``minv`` — direct mass-matrix inverse.
* ``forward_dynamics`` — forward dynamics via ``Minv·(τ − c)``.
* ``aba`` — articulated body algorithm (independent forward dynamics).
* ``crba`` — composite rigid body algorithm (mass matrix).
* ``inverse_dynamics_gradient`` — ∂(inverse_dynamics)/∂(q, qd).
* ``forward_dynamics_gradient`` — ∂(forward_dynamics)/∂(q, qd).
* ``end_effector_pose`` — end-effector pose.
* ``end_effector_pose_gradient`` — end-effector Jacobian.
* ``end_effector_pose_hessian`` — end-effector Hessian (∂²ee/∂q²).

**Second-order set (4 algorithms, 3 rows per cell)**:

* ``idsva_so`` — second-order inverse dynamics, codegen-time-dispatched
  to ``idsva_so_body_frame`` (fixed-base) or ``idsva_so_world_frame``
  (floating-base). The dispatcher row reports whichever variant the
  codegen picked for that cell.
* ``idsva_so_body_frame`` — body-frame propagation, multi-pass.
* ``idsva_so_world_frame`` — world-frame propagation, single-pass.
* ``fdsva_so`` — second-order forward dynamics.

The two IDSVA-SO variants are mathematically equivalent and ship
side-by-side so the report shows the body-vs-world crossover; per cell the
standalone variant that is bit-identical to the dispatcher's pick is
deduplicated (its row would time the exact same kernel twice), so the four
second-order algorithms contribute 3 rows — 13 rows in all. See
:doc:`../concepts/algorithms/idsva` for the dispatch rule details.

Beyond the 13 core rows, the per-algo harness's ``PER_ALGO_SPECS`` table
(``test/benchmarks/baselines/grid/run.py``) drives ~42 benchable keys in
total — the f_ext gradients, ``inverse_dynamics_regressor``,
``forward_dynamics_parameter_gradient``, the energy regressors, the
integrator family, ``multi_target_position``/``_gradient``, the runtime-EE
and frame-Jacobian families, the centroidal set, and the mjx twins — so
any of those can be timed the same way.

``GRIM_BENCH_EXTRA_NVCC_FLAGS`` is the compile-flag env seam: extra
``nvcc`` flags for the bench build (used for compile-flag A/Bs). The value
is folded into the bench's content stamp, so changing the flags correctly
invalidates the cached binaries instead of reusing a stale build.

Output schema
-------------

Each cell produces a JSON file at
``<output-dir>/<robot>_<base>_grim_<column>.json``. Each row in the JSON
captures three measurements per algorithm:

* **single-call** — wall time for one host-level invocation (one timestep).
  Anti-LICM machinery prevents the compiler from hoisting the call out of
  the rep-loop, so this is a real per-call cost, not amortized.
* **N=16 (compute)** — kernel-only time for a 16-timestep batch
  (excludes host→device / device→host transfer).
* **N=256 (compute)** — kernel-only time for a 256-timestep batch.

Pinocchio numbers are batch with-memory (CPU codegen makes
compute/transfer inseparable).

Stability and compile flags
---------------------------

A flag exists for working around hardware/toolchain quirks; the
default is correct on sm_120 (RTX 5090) and likely fine on sm_8x:

* ``--ptxas-opt-level 2`` — drops ptxas from -O3 to -O2, used when nvcc
  ptxas itself crashes (rare).

Per-host autotuning (recommended for production)
------------------------------------------------

For best performance on a given GPU, run the GLASS autotuner once per
host. It writes a per-host override file under
``external/GLASS/bench/tuning/<hostname>.cuh`` (the shipped table is left
untouched):

.. code-block:: shell

   cd external/GLASS
   python3 bench/autotune.py --sm AUTO

Wall time: ~10–15 minutes. Consume the override on subsequent builds
with ``-DGLASS_TUNING_TABLE_LOCAL='"external/GLASS/bench/tuning/<hostname>.cuh"'``.
See :doc:`../getting_started/installation` for details.

.. _autotune-launch-config:

Autotune launch config for your robot / GPU
-------------------------------------------

GRiM kernels are single-block and **thread-count-invariant** (same result
at any block size), so the optimal ``(resource_tier, threads_per_block)``
for each algorithm is a pure *performance* choice that depends on the
**robot** (DoF / topology) and the **GPU**. GRiM ships measured-optimal
launch configs under ``config/launch_configs/<robot>/<gpu>.json``; codegen bakes
the matching file into ``grim_launch_config.cuh`` and the host launchers
(and therefore the python / jax / torch bindings) default their launch
config from it. With no entry for your (robot, GPU), GRiM falls back to a
conservative — still correct, just slower — default.

To autotune **your** robot on **your** GPU and write the override:

.. code-block:: shell

   bash config/autotune_robot.sh <robot> [fixed floating]

   # examples
   bash config/autotune_robot.sh iiwa14             # fixed + floating
   bash config/autotune_robot.sh go2 floating        # floating only
   GPU_KEY=a40_sm86 bash config/autotune_robot.sh g1  # force the GPU key

This:

#. Detects your GPU (``nvidia-smi`` name + compute capability) and derives
   the GPU key ``<model>_sm<arch>`` (e.g. ``rtx5090_sm120``). If detection
   fails, set ``GPU_KEY=<model>_sm<arch>`` and re-run.
#. Runs the GRiM autotune sweep (``per_algo_bench.py --mode autotune
   --stage sweep``) for that robot + bases. The build is **RAM-safe
   serial** (``--compile-jobs 1``, one per-algo TU at a time) so the
   big-robot second-order TUs never OOM the box.
#. Converts the swept winners into ``config/launch_configs/<robot>/<gpu>.json`` in
   the documented schema (``gpu``, ``cuda_arch``, ``gpu_name``,
   ``autotune_N``, ``source``, ``bases``).

**Then rebuild to pick it up:** re-run codegen for the robot (codegen
auto-discovers the new ``launch_configs`` file) and rebuild GRiM / the
bindings as usual. The host launchers will default to your tuned
``(tier, threads)``.

.. note::

   **Single-call timing is OFF by default** (it is hard to time and needs
   the ``-rdc`` shim). The autotuner tunes on **batch** timing (``N=256`` by
   default; override with ``AUTOTUNE_N``), which is what the host launch
   config should optimize for. Opt single-call timing back in with
   ``--single-timing`` / ``GRIM_BENCH_SINGLE_TIMING=1`` only if you
   specifically need it.

Run the sweep on a **quiet GPU** — timing must be isolated, so close other
GPU workloads first.

**Crowdsource it (please do!):** once you have a good config, open a PR
adding ``config/launch_configs/<robot>/<gpu>.json`` (one file per (robot, GPU)) so
everyone defaults to fast launches on your hardware. No code changes are
needed — codegen auto-discovers the file. See
`config/launch_configs/README.md
<https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GRiD/blob/main/config/launch_configs/README.md>`_
for the full contribution checklist (GPU model, driver / CUDA version,
robot DoF / base to include in the PR description).

Cheap re-bake: ``refresh_launch_configs.sh``
--------------------------------------------

``config/refresh_launch_configs.sh`` re-bakes the live
``config/launch_configs/<robot>/<gpu>.json`` picks from an existing
tier-sweep **without** the day-long recompile: it harvests the latest
``results/tier_sweep_phased_*`` sweep (or a ``--sweep-dir`` you pass),
merges the picks, and bakes the per-robot ``bases`` (optionally
``ffi_bases`` with ``--with-ffi``), printing a ``git diff`` of
``config/launch_configs/`` at the end (it never commits).

**Which one when:** ``autotune_robot.sh`` builds a **full monolithic
per-tier binary**, so big robots (g1 / h2_plus) hit the ~hour
second-order recompile — use it for a robot/GPU with no prior sweep.
``refresh_launch_configs.sh`` reuses the cached split (noSO/SO)
binaries from a phased tier sweep
(``bash test/benchmarks/run_tier_sweep_phased.sh``), so re-baking after
a sweep costs no recompile at all.

Pre-GLASS regression check
--------------------------

The multi-version harness supports an automatic regression check
against the pre-GLASS reference commit (``d2c0d18``). Add ``pre_glass``
to ``--columns`` and the harness will:

#. Create a worktree at ``../GRiM-A2R-pre-glass`` (or
   ``$GRIM_PRE_GLASS_WORKTREE``).
#. Initialize submodules pinned to their pre-GLASS revisions.
#. Run the same cell list using that frozen harness.

The ``pre_glass`` column is fixed-base only — the pre-GLASS bench
harness predates floating-base support.

GPU-resident pipelines (no-transfer timing)
-------------------------------------------

GRiM's jax/torch handles can keep an entire control/rollout loop on the GPU —
inputs, dynamics calls, and downstream math never round-trip through host
memory. Two example pairs demonstrate and time this
(``bindings/examples/jax_gpu_resident.py`` / ``torch_cuda_graphs.py`` for the
iiwa14, and ``..._go2.py`` twins for the floating-base go2), driven by
``test/benchmarks/gpu_resident_timing.py``.

Measured on the RTX 5090 (sm_120, 2026-08-09,
``results/overnight_20260809/legC_gpu_resident.json``):

* **JAX resident rollout vs host round-trip** (a ``lax.scan`` rollout calling
  GRiM's dynamics each step): iiwa14 **24.3x / 14.5x / 7.3x** faster at batch
  64 / 256 / 1024 (1.5 ms vs 36.6 ms at B=64); go2-floating **6.8x / 6.9x /
  3.6x** (the floating rollout drives GRiM's own ``integrator`` kernel for the
  on-manifold base retract inside the scan).
* **Torch CUDA graphs**: replay wall-time is roughly break-even with eager
  (0.91-0.99x) — the win is in **CPU submission cost**, ~13 us eager vs ~1.9 us
  replay (**~6.6x**), which is what matters when the CPU is the bottleneck
  feeding a real-time control loop. (An earlier "replay slower than eager"
  reading was a harness artifact — it timed a per-iteration device copy-in;
  replay-only and copy-in variants are now recorded separately.)

Reproduce with ``.venv/bin/python test/benchmarks/gpu_resident_timing.py``
(quiet GPU; results land under ``test/benchmarks/results/``).

Second-order derivatives: the transfer question
-----------------------------------------------

Second-order derivative outputs scale as **nv³ per timestep** (g1's
``idsva_so`` at N=256 is a 175.6 MB result batch), so for these algorithms
the device→host copy — not the kernel — is the dominant with-memory cost.
On the g1 ``idsva_so`` N=256 cell the measured transfer delta was 13.2 ms
of a 15.2 ms with-mem total (**87 %**) with pageable host buffers, and is
still ~80 % of the (much smaller) total after pinning.

Two fixes ship for this:

* **Pinned host staging** — ``grim_host_alloc`` (``cudaMallocHost``)
  replaced pageable ``malloc`` for every ``grimData`` host buffer, raising
  effective D2H bandwidth on large payloads from 13.3 to ~21 GB/s (the
  box's PCIe-lane ceiling). That alone flipped **8 with-mem cells** vs
  Pinocchio (CPU, 24 threads) (11 losses + 2 ties → 5 losses + 8 wins); the
  per-cell before/after table is the "W2a re-capture" section of
  ``test/benchmarks/results/competitive_render_20260826/competitive_analysis.md``.
* **Not copying at all** — keep the tensor on the GPU (next section).

Staying resident (jax)
----------------------

The ``grim`` jax FFI path is device-in / device-out: under ``jit`` /
``lax.scan`` composition the nv³ tensor is produced on-device and consumed
by the next pipeline stage (a Hessian-vector product, a DDP backward pass)
with **zero host transfer**. Layer-3 timings (jax FFI, medians of 30 iters
after warmup, RTX 5090,
``test/benchmarks/results/night4_20260827/so_resident_results.json``), in
total-batch µs — *resident* = device-in/device-out, *out_host* = outputs
pulled to host, *roundtrip* = numpy-in → numpy-out:

Reading the table:

* The resident column carries a **~0.4–0.5 ms fixed per-call FFI dispatch
  overhead** (visible as the iiwa14 floor: kernel compute is ~43–72 µs,
  resident is ~515–530 µs). It is a per-*call* cost, so it amortizes when
  the call sits inside a jitted ``scan``/rollout rather than being invoked
  from python once per step.
* The resident-vs-out_host gap is pure output transfer, and it grows with
  nv³·B exactly as predicted: negligible for iiwa14, ~3.8 ms for go2
  ``idsva_so`` at N=256, ~32 ms for g1.
* The honest headline for the largest tensor: g1 ``idsva_so`` N=256
  **resident 2.87 ms vs Pinocchio (CPU, 24 threads) 2.38 ms total** — near
  parity on wall time, while the result is already on the GPU for the
  next pipeline stage instead of in host memory. If the consumer is on
  the GPU, resident wins outright; if the result must land in host
  memory, CPU codegen remains the right tool for this cell.

.. note::

   **Why the with-mem comparison is asymmetric by construction.** A CPU
   baseline pays no output copy — its results are *born* in host memory,
   so its with-mem time equals its compute time. The GPU with-mem column
   therefore carries the entire PCIe cost on top of compute. The
   three-layer reporting contract (compute-only / C++ with-mem /
   through-bindings; see ``test/benchmarks/BENCHMARK_METHODOLOGY.md``)
   exists precisely to keep that visible: layer 1 is the GPU-resident
   design point, layer 2 isolates transfer, layer 3 is what an adopter
   pays through the python bindings.
