Codegen Architecture
====================

Every GRiM algorithm is emitted in three layers (``_host`` / ``_kernel`` /
``_device``). Knowing the layering helps when you want to compose generated
functions, call kernels from your own CUDA host code, or read the emitter
source in ``grim_codegen/algorithms/``.

.. note::

   New here (human or agent)? Read :doc:`design_principles` first — it is the
   shared mental model (smart inners / thin wrappers, *the inner owns its memory
   placement*, the spill ladder, validation discipline, and the anti-patterns to
   avoid). This page covers the *mechanics* of the three layers; that page covers
   the *ethos* behind them.

The three emission layers
-------------------------

For each algorithm ``X`` (e.g. ``inverse_dynamics``, ``forward_dynamics``,
``crba``, ``fdsva_so``), the codegen emits:

* ``X_device`` — a ``__device__`` function with the **canonical caller-supplied
  buffer contract**. The caller passes pointers to inputs, outputs, ``s_temp``
  (shared scratch pool), and ``d_workspace`` (global scratch). The ``_device``
  function owns its **scratch placement**: a single ``if constexpr (!SCRATCH_IN_SMEM)
  { s_temp = d_workspace; }`` at the top routes the whole pool to global for
  spilled tiers. After that repoint, every consumer below (XImats helper, sub-
  inners, etc.) follows the placement, so the kernel never repoints ``s_temp``
  from the outside. This is the *inner-owns-placement* discipline; see
  :doc:`design_principles`.

* ``X_kernel`` — a ``__global__`` entry point that handles **batch scheduling**
  (``blockIdx.x`` loops over timesteps) and **global ↔ shared memory transfer**.
  It allocates ``__shared__`` smem for inputs/outputs and the ``s_temp`` pool,
  loads inputs, calls ``X_device``, and writes outputs back. Per-tier dispatch
  ( ``RESOURCE_TIER`` template ) picks the spill flags; the kernel never decides
  placement itself.

* ``X`` (no suffix) — a **host function** that wraps ``X_kernel`` and handles
  H↔D copies for inputs and outputs.

Inner helpers (``X_inner``, sub-step helpers like ``fdsva_so_contract``) still
exist where useful, but they are **internal to ``X_device``** — not part of the
external surface. Sub-algorithm composition routes through other algorithms'
``_inner`` helpers when they are placement-free building blocks (e.g.
``fdsva_so_device`` calls ``minv_inner`` and ``forward_dynamics_inner``
to reuse one XImats load across all of them).

Why orchestration moved into ``_device`` (history)
--------------------------------------------------

Pre-2026 the emitter shipped *four* layers: ``_inner`` (math),
``_full_inner`` (orchestrator + placement), ``_device`` (auto-allocating
training-wheels wrapper), ``_kernel``. The auto-allocating ``_device`` had
exactly one consumer (the equivalence runner) and its existence forced two
confusing things:

1. **Two functions with overlapping roles** — orchestration was duplicated in
   ``_full_inner`` (called from the kernel) and in the auto-allocating
   ``_device`` (which essentially re-emitted the same orchestration under
   ``SCRATCH_IN_SMEM=true``).
2. **Inconsistent placement contract** — some algorithms repointed ``s_temp``
   from the kernel (around the now-removed ``_device``), others repointed it
   inside ``_full_inner``. Reviewers had to chase which.

The 2026 rename collapses the two: ``_full_inner`` becomes the canonical
``_device`` (caller-supplied ``s_temp`` + ``d_workspace`` + spill flags;
``__device__ __forceinline__``; owns its placement), and the old auto-
allocating ``_device`` is gone. Inline-CUDA users either embed ``_device``
inside their own kernel (passing their own ``s_temp``) or call ``_kernel``
directly for batches. The host wrapper is unchanged.

Nested composition
------------------

The split exists for **nested composition**. Higher-level algorithms call
other algorithms' ``_inner`` (the placement-free math) directly to reuse one
expensive ``XImats`` load.

For example, second-order forward dynamics
(`_fdsva_so.py <https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GRiD/blob/main/grid_codegen/algorithms/_fdsva_so.py>`_)
needs both forward dynamics and direct inverse-mass-matrix outputs internally.
``fdsva_so_device`` loads XImats once at the top, then calls the placement-free
``_inner`` variants:

The final ``-Minv`` contraction of ``fdsva_so_contract`` (``iL,Ljk->ijk`` over the four
n³ tensors) is emitted register-tiled along ``i``: each thread produces ``R`` outputs
that share every strided arena load, where ``R`` is the largest divisor of ``n`` that is
at most 8 and leaves at least two tiles (35 → 7, 18 → 6, 7 → 1). The per-cell dot is
accumulated in exactly the untiled order, so the outputs are bit-identical to the
one-output-per-thread loop; measured on g1-floating the kernel is 7–11% faster
(2026-09-24). ``GRIM_FDSVA_SO_MINV_TILE=1`` at generation time forces the untiled loop
(an A/B knob; it is part of every header cache key).

The world-frame second-order inner (``idsva_so_world_frame_inner``, the floating-base
and mimic path) runs its triple ancestor walk with ONE pair of block barriers per body
column: every ancestor-or-self velocity column ``(j, t)`` of body ``i`` is built into a
per-pair scratch slab (``72 × WF_MAX_PAIRS`` floats, a codegen constant) in one parallel
loop, and one flattened ``(pair, k, r)`` loop then performs every contraction. The write
set was enumerated per topology to prove the cells written by different pairs are
disjoint, except the symmetric ``dM_dq`` pair on a multi-column body (the floating root),
whose sequential last writer (``vel_j > vel_k``) is made the sole writer — so the outputs
are bit-identical to the former per-pair loop while the kernel's barrier count falls by
an order of magnitude (go2 264 → 36; g1 712 → 70 per launch). Measured 2026-09-24:
idsva_so −20% and fdsva_so −18% of compute on g1-floating, −13…−52% on go2.

If the ``_inner`` building blocks were collapsed into their owning ``_device``,
the compositional algorithms would pay the XImats load three times instead of
once. The separation is a performance contract, not a stylistic preference.

Concrete signatures (RNEA / inverse_dynamics)
---------------------------------------------

.. code-block:: cuda

   // pure math; assumes s_XImats already loaded; placement-free
   template <typename T>
   __device__ void inverse_dynamics_inner(
       T *s_vaf, const T *s_q, const T *s_qd,
       /* topology + scratch */ T *s_temp,
       const T gravity);

   // canonical _device: caller-supplied buffers + scratch; owns placement
   template <typename T>
   __device__ void inverse_dynamics_device(
       T *s_c, const T *s_q, const T *s_qd,
       const robotModel<T> *d_robotModel, const T gravity);

   // global entry, batched over timesteps; per-tier RESOURCE_TIER dispatch
   template <typename T, int RESOURCE_TIER = GRIM_DEFAULT_RESOURCE_TIER>
   __global__ void inverse_dynamics_kernel(
       T *d_c, const T *d_q_qd, const int stride_q_qd,
       const robotModel<T> *d_robotModel, const T gravity,
       const int NUM_TIMESTEPS);

   // CPU launcher with H↔D copies
   template <typename T, bool USE_QDD_FLAG=false, bool USE_COMPRESSED_MEM=false>

       const T gravity, const int num_timesteps,
       dim3 block_dimms, dim3 thread_dimms, cudaStream_t *streams);

Orchestrator signature (fdsva_so / inverse_dynamics_gradient / forward_dynamics_gradient / integrator_gradient)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The orchestrators take the placement flags + a ``d_workspace`` pointer in
addition to the standard inputs:

.. code-block:: cuda

   template <typename T,
             bool SCRATCH_IN_SMEM = true,        // s_temp pool location
             bool FD_GRAD_USE_SPILL = false,     // selective spill bits
             bool CONTRACT_IN_SMEM = true>       // (fdsva_so only)
   __device__ __forceinline__
   void fdsva_so_device(
       T *s_df2, T *s_idsva_so, T *s_Minv, T *s_df_du, T *s_qdd,
       const T *s_q, const T *s_qd, const T *s_u,
       /* XImats helpers */
       T *s_temp,              // smem pool; ignored when !SCRATCH_IN_SMEM
       T *d_workspace,         // global pool; ignored when SCRATCH_IN_SMEM
       T *d_fd_grad_spill,     // band-spill region; nullptr unless FD_GRAD_USE_SPILL
       T *s_fdsva_temp,        // contraction scratch; per CONTRACT_IN_SMEM
       const robotModel<T> *d_robotModel, const T gravity);

The kernel emitter passes per-tier ``true``/``false`` literals for the
template flags and threads the right ``d_workspace`` offsets in. Inline-CUDA
users size their smem from ``*_DEVICE_INLINE_SMEM_BYTES<T, TIER>()`` and
``d_workspace`` from ``*_DEVICE_INLINE_WORKSPACE_BYTES<T, TIER>()``.

Thread-count assumptions
------------------------

GRiM emits a ``MAX_PERF_LEVEL_THREADS`` constant per generated header, computed
from the robot's DVA parallelism (rounded up to a warp, capped at 512) —
for iiwa14 it is 352, for go2_fixed it is 288, and so on. The host
wrappers default to launching with ``dim3(MAX_PERF_LEVEL_THREADS, 1, 1)``.

After the v2.0 cuBLASDx removal, ``MAX_PERF_LEVEL_THREADS`` is **a hint, not
an enforced floor**. Every emitted ``X_inner`` does block-cooperative
compute on one timestep — threads within a block split work via
*block-stride loops* (the ``gen_add_parallel_loop`` helper emits
``for (int i = threadIdx.x + threadIdx.y*blockDim.x; i < max_val;
i += blockDim.x*blockDim.y)``). Any block size that fits per-block
covers the work correctly. Batching across timesteps is handled by
the outer ``X_kernel`` via a *grid-stride loop* over ``blockIdx`` —
each block processes one or more timesteps.

CUDA-inline users can launch GRiM kernels with any block size that
suits their outer kernel. See :doc:`cublasdx_removal_design` for the
rationale.

Design sweet spot: tens-to-hundreds of parallel computations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The one-timestep-per-block layout — block-cooperative compute inside,
grid-stride over batch outside — is **tuned for batch sizes in the
tens to hundreds**. Many batch robotics workloads (MPC shooting nodes,
trajectory optimization horizons, behavioral cloning rollouts, real-time
control with N robots) sit squarely in that range, which is the design
target.

For very small batches (N=1-8) the per-block fixed overhead dominates,
and a design that packed multiple timesteps per block could be faster;
for very large batches (N=10k+) a design that splits one timestep
across multiple blocks could expose more parallelism. Neither is what
GRiM optimizes for. If your workload sits at one of those extremes, a
codegen layered on a different parallelism map (or an entirely
different library) will likely beat GRiM; for the tens-to-hundreds
range, GRiM's layout is the right tool.

The ``MAX_PERF_LEVEL_THREADS`` constant is what the codegen picks as the
best block-cooperative thread count for *this robot* (DOF-aware,
warp-rounded). External callers are free to override (see
:py:meth:`grim.RobotHandle.set_threads_per_block` or
``grim_set_threads_per_block`` in the C ABI), but smaller block
sizes will be slower at the same batch size (work-per-block stays
constant; fewer threads cover it).

Each ``X_kernel`` is emitted with ``__launch_bounds__(tier_max_threads<RESOURCE_TIER>())`` —
tier-templated and load-bearing (it is what ``grim_kernel_max_threads`` introspects and
what the baked-THREADS clamp validates against). Only the integrator family still uses
``MAX_PERF_LEVEL_THREADS``. (An older revision here said the attribute was "about to drop
in phase B1" — that plan was superseded; "B1/B2" now name the tier-matrix/kernel-attr
phases in the live plan.)

Per-algo metadata: the descriptor table
---------------------------------------

Each algorithm also carries a small amount of *irregular* per-algo metadata:
which autotune launch-config key(s) it uses, the ``cudaFuncSetAttribute`` opt-in
gate, the dynamic-shared-memory bytes-macro stem, whether it has an mjx
(MUJOCO_OUTPUT) twin, and so on. This lives as one ``AlgoDescriptor`` row per
algorithm in ``grim_codegen/algo_registry.py`` (the ``ALGO_DESCRIPTORS``
tuple) — the **single source of truth** from which the generator derives:

* the ``GrimAlgo`` enum and the launch-config symbol map (``build_launch_config_algo_to_symbol``),
* the ``KERNEL_ATTR_MANIFEST`` and the mjx (floating-twin) manifest heads.

Previously these were several hand-maintained module-level dicts that had to be
kept in lockstep by hand; the descriptor table removed that duplication. Adding
an algorithm is now (metadata-wise) one row. ``test/test_algo_descriptor_parity.py``
locks the table to the generated output so a mismatch fails CPU-only in CI. The
per-algo arena/spill ``t_count`` math is now folded into the table too (the
``ArenaRegion`` / ``SpillRung`` / ``ArenaCtx`` machinery in ``algo_registry.py``,
composed by ``compose_arena_full`` / ``compose_arena_rungs``): every
``select_shared_tier_3way`` site is driven from the composer, so arena sizes are no
longer hand-written in ``GRiMCodeGenerator.py``. The arena's correctness is guarded
independently by ``test/test_shared_arena_covers_carve.py``, which checks each
kernel's launch-sizing macro against the regions the kernel actually carves. To
change an algorithm's arena, edit its closure in ``algo_registry.py`` — do NOT
hand-edit ``t_count`` expressions in the generator.

The binding surface: generated from ``abi_specs.py``
-----------------------------------------------------

The descriptor table has a sibling: ``grim_codegen/abi_specs.py`` (the
``ABI_SPECS`` rows) transcribes every C-ABI body of the Python binding —
signature, packing, qdd/f_ext routing, launch template shape, output
buffer/size, mjx-twin variance — and ``grim_codegen/wrapper_body_gen.py``
EMITS six checked-in generated regions of
``bindings/grim/wrapper_template.cu`` from those rows:

1. the ``extern "C"`` algorithm bodies (30+ functions),
2. the ``grim_kernel_max_threads`` introspection branch table,
3. all 30 ``grim_<algo>_mujoco`` twin bodies,
4. the JAX FFI handlers,
5. the torch op bodies,
6. the torch op table.

``grim_codegen/wrapper_plant_gen.py`` emits the remaining two generated
regions — the JAX plant tail and the torch plant tail — for eight
``BEGIN/END GENERATED`` regions in all. The regions live between those
markers **in the checked-in file** — never hand-edit inside them. To change a generated body, edit the
spec row (or the emitter) and regenerate::

    .venv/bin/python -m grim_codegen.wrapper_body_gen          # rewrite
    .venv/bin/python -m grim_codegen.wrapper_body_gen --check  # CI drift gate

``test/test_wrapper_generated_block.py`` runs ``--check`` in CI, and
``test/test_abi_spec_crosscheck.py`` validates every spec field against the
template text — so a hand-edit inside a marker region, or a stale block after
a table edit, fails a plain ``pytest -q``. Only ``tool_fext``,
``contact_fext`` (``wrapper_template.cu`` ~:902-967, outside the generated
C-ABI region), ``fk_batched``, the four plant cost twins, and the
plant/FFI/torch/pybind scaffolding outside the marker regions remain
hand-written (bespoke by design).

The same table also drives the **numpy Runner's pybind surface**:
``grim_codegen/core_body_gen.py`` emits the generated region of
``bindings/src/_core.cpp`` — the 61 spec-backed value/gradient/second-order
methods plus their ``has_*_mujoco`` accessors — from each row's
``inputs``/``py_out_dims``/``py_rc3_msg``/``py_twin_guard`` fields
(``-m grim_codegen.core_body_gen`` to regenerate, ``--check`` gated by
``test/test_core_generated_block.py``). Adding an algorithm's spec row
therefore produces its wrapper C-ABI body, its mjx twin, AND its pybind
method in one regeneration. The pybind ``.def`` list (with its user-facing
docstrings), the plant family, and the metadata/overlay surface stay
hand-written.
