Library-safe initialization and cleanup
=======================================

Every generated ``grim.cuh`` builds the per-robot device tables once, on the
host: the spatial transforms and inertias (``d_XImats``), the topology helpers,
the joint limits and, when opted in, the mutable runtime tables (inertia,
transform, joint dynamics). Historically these initializers used the
``gpuErrchk`` policy: on any CUDA error they printed, called
``cudaDeviceReset()`` and ``exit()``-ed the process. That is right for a
benchmark binary and wrong for a library embedded in a Python interpreter or a
long-lived service. Since 2026-09-22 the header emits a second, nonterminating
spelling of the same construction and destruction logic.

The contract
------------

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include "grim.cuh"

   grim::robotModel<float> *model = nullptr;
   const char *failed_op = nullptr;
   cudaError_t e = grim::init_robotModel_checked<float>(&model, &failed_op);
   if (e != cudaSuccess) {
       // model == nullptr; nothing acquired by this attempt is still allocated
       throw std::runtime_error(std::string(failed_op) + ": " + cudaGetErrorString(e));
   }
   float *limits = nullptr;
   e = grim::init_joint_limits_checked<float>(&limits, &failed_op);
   ...
   e = grim::free_robotModel_checked<float>(model, &failed_op);   // reportable cleanup

* ``init_robotModel_checked`` / ``init_joint_limits_checked`` /
  ``init_XImats_checked`` / ``init_topology_helpers_checked`` and the
  ``init_*_params_checked`` runtime-table initializers return ``cudaError_t``,
  never ``exit``, ``abort`` or ``cudaDeviceReset``. Every owned pointer is
  null before the first fallible call; construction stops at the first failed
  operation; every resource acquired by *that attempt* is released in reverse
  order; ``*out`` is written on complete success only. Host allocations are
  checked too (a failed ``calloc`` reports ``cudaErrorMemoryAllocation``);
  the joint-limit table no longer touches the heap at all.
* ``failed_op`` (optional) receives a static string naming the operation that
  failed (``"cudaMalloc(d_XImats)"``, ``"cudaMemcpy(d_robotModel)"``,
  ``"calloc(h_inertia_params)"``, ...). The **primary** error is what you get
  back: a cleanup failure during rollback never overwrites it.
* ``free_robotModel_checked(model, &failed_op)``: ``nullptr`` is a no-op
  returning ``cudaSuccess``. The struct is copied back to recover the nested
  device pointers; if that copy fails, nothing else is touched, the copy error
  is returned and the nested arrays leak (documented limitation, it means the
  context is already unusable). Cleanup continues past a failed ``cudaFree``
  and returns the first error.
* **Device affinity.** A model is bound to the device that was current when
  it was built. ``free_robotModel_checked`` validates that with
  ``cudaPointerGetAttributes`` and returns ``cudaErrorInvalidDevice`` (freeing
  nothing) if another device is current. Ownership is never mixed across
  devices silently.
* **Lost contexts.** After a sticky/context-invalidating error
  (``cudaErrorIllegalAddress`` and friends) every CUDA call fails; the checked
  functions report that faithfully and clean up best-effort. They do not, and
  cannot, recover the context.
* **Threading.** The checked API keeps no shared state: each call reports
  through its own return value and out-parameters, so concurrent construction
  of different models on one device is well-defined (CUDA runtime calls are
  thread-safe). The legacy sticky slot (below) is a single non-atomic
  process-wide first-error slot and is *not* part of this contract.

Streams, arena and teardown (part 2)
------------------------------------

The same contract covers the rest of the lifecycle, so a whole GRiM instance
can be brought up and torn down without a single terminating path:

.. code-block:: cpp

   cudaStream_t *streams = nullptr; grim::robotModel<float> *model = nullptr;
   grim::grimData<float> *data = nullptr; const char *op = nullptr;
   cudaError_t e = grim::init_grim_checked<float>(&streams, &op);          // kernel attrs + streams
   if (e == cudaSuccess) e = grim::init_robotModel_checked<float>(&model, &op);
   if (e == cudaSuccess) e = grim::init_grimData_checked<float, N>(&data, &op);   // or (n, &data, &op)
   if (e != cudaSuccess) {
       grim::close_grim_checked<float>(streams, model, data);   // null stages are no-ops
       throw std::runtime_error(std::string(op) + ": " + cudaGetErrorString(e));
   }
   ...
   e = grim::close_grim_checked<float>(streams, model, data, &op);

* ``init_grim_kernel_attrs_checked`` returns the first
  ``cudaFuncSetAttribute`` / shared-memory fit-check error and names the
  kernel; ``init_grim_streams_checked`` destroys every stream it created
  before reporting a later failure; ``init_grim_checked`` composes the two.
* ``init_grimData_checked`` guards all ~80 device and host allocations of the
  batch arena (and the memsets/copies between them). Its release list is
  **derived from the allocation list at generation time** (one emitted line
  list feeds the constructor, the rollback and ``close_grim_checked``), so
  the two can never drift the way a hand-written free list could. Host
  staging buffers (pinned, with a pageable fallback) are checked too.
* ``close_grim_checked(streams, model, data, &op)``: every argument may be
  ``nullptr`` (a no-op), cleanup continues past a failed free/destroy, the
  first error is returned and named, and a caller-installed device pool is
  rewound afterwards exactly as before.
* The legacy ``init_grim`` / ``init_grim_streams`` / ``init_grim_kernel_attrs``
  / ``init_grimData`` / ``close_grim`` keep their signatures and policy as
  thin wrappers.

The ``grim`` bindings construct streams, model and arena through the
checked calls and release the completed stages on a later failure, so a
failed registration leaves nothing allocated and raises a Python exception
naming the operation.

Owning handle
-------------

``grim::robotModel_owner<T>`` is a noncopyable, movable RAII wrapper:

.. code-block:: cpp

   grim::robotModel_owner<float> owner;
   if (owner.init(&failed_op) != cudaSuccess) { ... }
   use(owner.get());
   cudaError_t ce = owner.free(&failed_op);   // explicit, reportable
   // or let the destructor free best-effort; release() hands the raw pointer back

Legacy spellings
----------------

``init_robotModel()``, ``init_joint_limits()``, ``init_XImats()``,
``init_topology_helpers()``, ``init_*_params()`` and ``free_robotModel()`` are
thin wrappers over the checked functions that apply the historical policy:
print the failed operation, then ``gpuAssert`` (``cudaDeviceReset``+``exit``
by default; under ``-DGRIM_GPUERRCHK_NO_EXIT`` record the first error in the
sticky slot readable through ``grim_last_error()`` /
``grim_consume_last_error()`` and return ``nullptr``). Their signatures and
behaviour are unchanged, and there is exactly one construction/destruction
implementation underneath. The Python bindings (``grim``) construct the
model through the checked path and translate a failure into a Python
exception naming the operation.

Testing the failure paths
-------------------------

Two host-only macros are the fault-injection seams: ``GRIM_CUDA_CALL(expr)``
wraps every CUDA runtime call the checked initializers make and
``GRIM_HOST_ALLOC(expr)`` every host allocation. They default to the bare
expression (no runtime cost, never used in device code). A test translation
unit defines them *before* including ``grim.cuh`` to fail the N-th call
deterministically; ``test/cuda_equivalents/test_cuda_safe_init.py`` does this
for every call in the construction sequence, for host allocation failure, for
copy-back and nested-free failures during destruction, and for the legacy
exit path (in a subprocess), on a serial arm and on a floating-base robot with
every runtime table enabled.
