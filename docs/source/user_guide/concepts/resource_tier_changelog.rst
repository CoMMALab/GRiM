Resource-Tier Changelog
=======================

The shipped-work log for the tier/spill system, split out of
:doc:`resource_tier_system` on 2026-09-09. Newest-relevant first is NOT
guaranteed — these are historical records in their original order.

MT output tiering — W2b Component B (2026-09-16)
------------------------------------------------

The runtime multi-target (MT) kernels — ``multi_target_position`` /
``multi_target_position_gradient`` — are output-tiered. At ``TIER_SHARED``
they stage per-timestep outputs in static shared memory and copy out; at
spilled tiers they write direct-to-global (``&d_out[k*out_size]``) with
per-timestep inner scratch placed in the ``d_workspace`` SO band. The
generated hosts pass ``hd_data->d_workspace`` and use workspace-clamped
launches.

Integrator surgical spill (value + gradient)
--------------------------------------------

The time-integrator kernels follow the same "spill the cold buffers, keep the
hot path in shared memory" philosophy. Both compose **existing** placement
levers from their callees rather than introducing a whole-arena dump.

**Value path** (``integrator_kernel``). The kernel runs forward dynamics per
stage; its dominant inner buffer is the FD inner's Minv F-region (``6·NV²``).
It threads the existing ``forward_dynamics_inner<T, MINV_F_IN_SMEM>`` lever:

* Level 0 (SHARED on robots that fit): F stays in ``s_temp`` (shared).
* Level 1 (LITE/MINIMAL, or SHARED on h1_2): F spills to ``d_workspace`` while the
  hot FD path stays in smem. The overflow on h1_2 is only a few KB, so this
  single surgical lever is enough — h1_2 fixed/floating drop from 103/124 KB to
  ~41/46 KB. ``integrator_kernel`` gained ``unsigned char *d_workspace`` as its
  2nd argument; ``INTEGRATOR_DYNAMIC_SHARED_MEM_BYTES<T, TIER>`` and
  ``INTEGRATOR_MINV_F_IN_SMEM<TIER>`` are tier-aware.

**Gradient path** (``integrator_gradient_kernel`` / ``..._with_x_kp1``). A
4-rung ladder, least-spill first, spilling only cold / output / coalesced
matrices to **distinct, non-aliasing** ``d_workspace`` sub-offsets (the
gradient never runs concurrently with
inverse_dynamics_gradient/forward_dynamics_gradient/fdsva_so, so it reuses those
sections):

.. list-table:: Integrator-gradient spill ladder
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 8 52 40

   * - Rung
     - Spills (all in ``d_workspace``)
     - Example tier/robot
   * - 0
     - nothing (full smem)
     - small robots at SHARED
   * - 1
     - ``s_D_qdd_stage`` (``max_stages·NV·3NV``)
     - g1_fixed SHARED
   * - 2
     - rung 1 + ``s_dAB`` output (``2NV·3NV``) + inverse_dynamics_gradient **selective** (da_df band only;
       the FD-grad inner stays in smem, just smaller)
     - g1_floating SHARED — hot path stays in smem
   * - 3
     - rung 2 + the **whole** FD-grad inner ``s_temp`` (inverse_dynamics_gradient global_temp)
     - h1_2 fixed/floating — the inner is 160-441 KB, physically can't fit a
       100 KB box, so this is unavoidable

The sub-offsets are ``GRIM_INTEGRATOR_DU_DAB_OFFSET_BYTES`` and
``GRIM_INTEGRATOR_DU_INNER_OFFSET_BYTES`` (Dqdd sits at offset 0); the
placement per tier is exposed via ``INTEGRATOR_DU_{D_QDD,DAB}_IN_SMEM<TIER>``
and ``INTEGRATOR_DU_INNER_LEVEL<TIER>``. The gradient scaffold that feeds the
final dAB assembly (``s_dc_du`` / ``s_vaf`` / ``s_Minv``) always stays in smem.

**Why a whole-inner rung exists here but not for, e.g., the value path.** For
the value path the overflow is tiny, so one surgical lever closes it. For the
gradient on the biggest *floating* humanoid (h1_2), the FD-gradient inner
scratch *alone* exceeds the per-block smem cap, so some of the hot path must go
to L2-pinned global at MINIMAL — there is no surgical decomposition that keeps
it in smem. Rung 3 is therefore a physically-forced backstop used only where
rung 2 can't fit, not the default.

idsva_so (body + world frame) — done
------------------------------------

The IDSVA-SO surgical-spill follow-up that earlier revisions of this doc listed
as deferred is **implemented**: both frames use a ``select_shared_tier_3way``
ladder. Body rungs are {full, output→global, +BC→global (surgical),
+whole-s_temp→global}; world rungs are {full, output→global,
+whole-s_temp→global}. The fixed body inner is monolithic/aliased, so the
surgical BC spill is small relative to a humanoid's smem gap and the whole-arena
rung is what makes h1_2 fit (at a perf cost); a finer hot/cold de-alias of that
inner remains a tracked refactor (``docs/idsva_so_inner_refactor_notes.md``).

Humanoid-scale spill (``humanoid-tier-spill``, landed)
------------------------------------------------------

This bundle (branched off ``modernizing-tests``) brought every overflowing
kernel under the sm_120 ~100 KB cap on humanoid-scale robots. It was staged in
chunks; all are now landed (the integrator + idsva_so surgical spills described
above were the final pieces):

**Chunk 1: bench harness h1_2 enablement + failure tolerance** (shipped)
  - ``h1_2`` (Unitree H1.2, NV=51 fixed, 57 floating) added to the
    multi-version bench's ``ROBOTS`` tuple + EE-frame maps in
    ``run_multi_version.py`` and all four baseline runners
    (``baselines/{grid,pinocchio,mjx,frax}/run.py``).
  - **Per-algo runtime skip**: ``baselines/grid/run.py``'s
    ``PER_ALGO_SPECS`` (the single source of truth for each algo's bench
    call) wires ``GRIM_SKIP_*`` macros for every measured kernel. When ``grim_kernel_fits_device(SHARED_BYTES)``
    is false, the measure function prints a parseable ``... SKIPPED``
    line and returns. ``timing_parser.py`` ignores the SKIPPED line and
    ``fill_nulls`` populates the algo with null —
    ``generate_report.py`` renders missing cells as ``—``.
  - Net result: a baseline sweep including h1_2 now produces a real row
    for every (algo, robot, base) cell that fits the sm_120 ~100 KB
    per-block cap, and graceful ``—`` placeholders for cells that
    overflow. No more "one overflowing kernel kills the whole binary."

**Chunk 2: 3-way spill picker infrastructure** (shipped, dormant)
  - ``cuda_target_lite_shared_mem_bytes`` (default 48 KB, env-overridable)
    added to ``GRiMCodeGenerator.__init__``.
  - ``select_shared_tier_3way(*t_counts)`` returns
    ``(perf_pick, lite_pick, minimal_pick)`` indices into the algorithm's
    spill-level list. SHARED picks the lowest-spill fitting
    ``cuda_target_shared_mem_bytes`` (~98 KB); LITE picks the lowest-spill
    fitting ``cuda_target_lite_shared_mem_bytes`` (~48 KB), clamped to
    ``≥`` SHARED; MINIMAL is always the most-spill index.
  - Five algos now populate ``self.<algo>_spill_tier_3way`` plus
    ``self.<algo>_t_count_per_tier`` (3-tuple of arena t_counts):
    ``inverse_dynamics_gradient``, ``forward_dynamics_gradient``,
    ``end_effector_pose_hessian``, ``fdsva_so``, ``idsva_so_body_frame``.
  - **No emit-path change yet** — existing single-body emission uses
    the SHARED pick (= today's behavior). The picks are available for
    introspection by tests + future per-tier emit work.

**Chunk 3: per-tier ``if constexpr`` emission per algo** (4 of 5 shipped)
  - Each kernel now dispatches on its 3-way picks: collapsed picks emit a
    single body (current behavior), divergent picks emit
    ``if constexpr (RESOURCE_TIER == TIER_X)`` branches with per-tier
    spill flags. The tier-aware ``*_DYNAMIC_SHARED_MEM_BYTES<T, TIER>``
    constexpr reports per-tier smem requirements (default ``TIER = TIER_SHARED``
    preserves all existing single-arg call sites).
  - **Shipped**: ``end_effector_pose_hessian``, ``inverse_dynamics_gradient``,
    ``forward_dynamics_gradient``, ``fdsva_so`` (commit
    ``8e5ff50``). Verified via nvcc compile of go2_fixed (FULL 3-way
    divergence on end_effector_pose_hessian + fdsva_so picks) and h1_2_fixed
    (SHARED=1, LITE/MIN=2 divergence on end_effector_pose_hessian +
    inverse_dynamics_gradient). Smoke test passes on iiwa14 (picks
    collapse).
  - **Deferred**: ``idsva_so_body_frame``. Its current spill machinery is
    asymmetric (``grav_full_spill`` only applies to floating-base, and is
    auto-triggered only when ``use_global_output`` already exceeds the
    target). The 3-way picks would need a per-base spill-level enumeration.
    Better to restructure this in tandem with Phase 3 (which will add new
    spill levels for h1_2 anyway).

**Where Phase 2b divergence shows up empirically** (from the per-tier picks
survey across 4 robots × 2 bases):

For robots where picks collapse, the kernel emits a single body (current
behavior, byte-identical to pre-Phase-2b). For divergent rows, the kernel
emits 2 or 3 specialized bodies inside ``if constexpr`` branches.

**Chunk 4: new spill levels for h1_2-overflowing kernels** (landed)
  All h1_2-overflowing kernels now have surgical spill ladders that bring them
  under the sm_120 ~100 KB cap. The design that landed matches the v2.0
  philosophy — push the cold / output / coalesced buffers first, keep the hot
  recursion in smem, and fall back to a whole-inner spill only where the inner
  alone exceeds the cap (physically forced, e.g. fdsva_so / idsva_so / the
  integrator gradient on h1_2). ``select_shared_tier_3way`` picks the lowest
  fitting rung per tier. Per-algo specifics:

  * **Minv / FD**: split the ``6·NV²`` ``s_F`` region out as a separate
    ``s_F`` / ``d_workspace`` parameter (Level 1 surgical). On h1_2_fixed this
    alone drops Minv 100 KB → ~38 KB.
  * **ABA**: the 140·NJ recursion band has no clean sub-split, so its Level 1
    redirects the whole inner ``s_temp`` to L2-pinned workspace.
  * **end_effector_pose_gradient / end_effector_pose_hessian / inverse_dynamics_gradient / forward_dynamics_gradient / fdsva_so**: 3-6 level ladders
    spilling inner_temp, then the output, then (fdsva_so) ``s_df_du`` / ``s_Minv``.
  * **idsva_so (body + world)**: ladders spilling the 4·NV³ output, then BC
    (body, surgical), then the whole inner. See "idsva_so — done" above.
  * **integrator (value + gradient)**: see "Integrator surgical spill" above.

  Where a surgical sub-split exists it is preferred; the whole-inner rung is the
  guaranteed-fit backstop. The remaining finer-grained win (de-aliasing the
  monolithic idsva_so / fdsva_so inners so even MINIMAL keeps more of the hot
  band in smem) is tracked in ``docs/idsva_so_inner_refactor_notes.md``.

**L2 cache pinning (default-ON in v2.0; flipped to default-OFF 2026-09-15
on measurement)**

``GRIM_CUDA_ENABLE_L2_PERSISTING`` originally defaulted to 1: the
``init_grimData`` wrapper calls ``grim_begin_l2_persisting`` on
``d_workspace`` once at allocation time (paired with
``grim_end_l2_persisting`` in ``close_grim``), intending spilled hot
buffers (Minv-F at 3a, FD's Minv-F at 3b, ABA's scratch at 3c,
FDSVA_SO's df_du/Minv at 3e) to live in persisting L2.

**2026-09-15 measured verdict — the pin never helps.** A/B on RTX 5090
(spilling algos + shared controls on iiwa14-fixed / g1-floating /
h1_2-floating; two prebuilt arms, 4 ABBA reps, spreads ≤0.7%): 0 cells
helped, 17 of 51 hurt (OFF faster up to 23% — integrator family across
all robots, h1_2 crba −18 %, minv −9/−10 %, h1_2 idsva_so −3.8 %),
34 neutral. Because the window is installed at ``init_grimData``, it
taxes every kernel on the stream — including non-spilling ones — and the
hitRatio-0.6 persisting carve evicts more useful L2 traffic than it
saves; the plain L2 already caches the spilled band. The generated
default is now ``0``; the begin/end helpers remain, so a workload that
measures a win can opt back in with
``-DGRIM_CUDA_ENABLE_L2_PERSISTING=1``. Raw data:
``test/benchmarks/results/l2pin_ab_20260915/``.

**Phase 3a + 3b + 3c + 3d + 3e shipped — Minv + FD + ABA + END_EFFECTOR_POSE_GRADIENT + FDSVA_SO L4-5 spill landed**

* **Phase 3d (END_EFFECTOR_POSE_GRADIENT)**: mirrors the END_EFFECTOR_POSE_HESSIAN 3-tier spill pattern. SHARED
  keeps the full inner_temp + s_deePos + dXmatsHom in smem; LITE pushes the
  recursion-hot inner_temp (2*2*16*num_ees*n T = ~52 KB on humanoid-scale)
  to L2-pinned workspace and writes ``s_deePos`` directly into global
  output; MINIMAL also pushes ``s_dXmatsHom`` (16*n T) to workspace.
  ``end_effector_pose_gradient_kernel`` now takes ``unsigned char *d_workspace``
  as its new 2nd argument. ``END_EFFECTOR_POSE_GRADIENT_DYNAMIC_SHARED_MEM_BYTES<T, TIER>()``
  is tier-aware. The workspace section reuses the SO offset (END_EFFECTOR_POSE_GRADIENT
  and SO algos don't run concurrently). Per-(robot) picks:

  - iiwa14_fixed/floating: (0, 0, 2) — SHARED/LITE alias to full smem;
    MINIMAL spills inner_temp + dxhom
  - go2_fixed/floating: (0, 0, 2) — same
  - h1_2_fixed/floating: (1, 1, 2) — SHARED/LITE both already spill
    inner_temp + s_deePos; MINIMAL additionally spills dxhom

  Smoke (nvcc -gencode arch=compute_120,code=sm_120, all 9 emitted kernels
  × 3 tiers per robot): iiwa14_fixed/go2_fixed/h1_2_fixed all 27/27 PASS.
  h1_2_fixed END_EFFECTOR_POSE_GRADIENT compiles clean at 40/40/50 registers (SHARED/LITE/MINIMAL).

* **Phase 3e (FDSVA_SO Level 4 + 5)**: extends the existing 4-level spill machinery
  with two new top levels. Level 4 pushes ``s_df_du`` (2*NV²) to a new
  ``GRIM_FDSVA_SO_SPILL_OFFSET_BYTES`` workspace section past grad + SO;
  Level 5 also pushes ``s_Minv`` (NV²). The new workspace section is
  sized only when MINIMAL (or any tier) picks ≥ 4 (so iiwa14 doesn't pay
  the allocation). Per-(algo, robot) picks:

  - iiwa14_fixed: (0, 0, 5) — MINIMAL spills max
  - go2_fixed: (0, 1, 5) — full 3-way divergence
  - g1_fixed: (2, 5, 5) — LITE/MINIMAL aggressive
  - g1_floating: (3, 5, 5)
  - h1_2_fixed: (5, 5, 5) — all tiers max-spill (still doesn't fit 99 KB;
    XI tables are the dominant cost on humanoid-scale; defer to a future
    XI-streaming refactor)
  - h1_2_floating: (5, 5, 5)



Status (commits ``da831dd`` + ``0795442`` + (3c-tbd)):

* **Phase 3c (ABA)** uses a different spill pattern than 3a/3b. ABA's 140*NJ+138
  interleaved scratch band has no natural surgical sub-split — it's all one
  tightly-coupled recursion. So Level 1 redirects the *entire* ``s_temp``
  arena to L2-pinned workspace (analogous to the existing
  ``inverse_dynamics_gradient`` ``use_global_temp`` pattern). A side effect of Phase 3b: ABA's
  ``inner_temp_mem_size`` decreased on floating-base because the defensive
  ``max(140*NJ+138, fd_inner_size)`` formula now sees a smaller FD inner
  (post-F-removal). On h1_2_floating ABA's Level 0 arena dropped enough
  that it now fits the 99 KB cap without spill — picks are
  ``aba=(0, 1, 1)``: SHARED/LITE use full smem on most robots, LITE on
  h1_2_floating spills (~48KB target).



Status (commits ``da831dd`` + ``0795442``):

* ``minv_inner`` now takes ``T *s_F`` as a separate 6*NV*NV scratch
  parameter; ``forward_dynamics_inner`` analogously takes ``T *s_minv_F``.
  Callers decide whether the F-region lives in extra smem (Level 0,
  preserves current behavior on small robots) or L2-pinned workspace
  (Level 1, frees ~62 KB smem on humanoid-scale robots).
* ``minv_kernel`` and ``forward_dynamics_kernel`` now both take
  ``unsigned char *d_workspace`` as their new 2nd argument. The per-tier
  ``select_shared_tier_3way`` picks Level 0 vs Level 1 based on the
  ``cuda_target_shared_mem_bytes`` (SHARED, 98 KB), ``cuda_target_lite_shared_mem_bytes``
  (LITE, 48 KB), and "always max spill" (MINIMAL) targets.
* ``MINV_DYNAMIC_SHARED_MEM_BYTES<T, TIER>`` and
  ``FORWARD_DYNAMICS_DYNAMIC_SHARED_MEM_BYTES<T, TIER>`` are now tier-aware constexprs
  reporting per-tier smem footprints (default ``TIER = TIER_SHARED`` preserves
  every existing single-arg call site).
* Verified via nvcc compile of h1_2_fixed at all 3 tiers:

  - **h1_2_fixed Minv**: 100 KB → 37 KB smem (SHARED picks surgical at h1_2-scale)
  - **h1_2_fixed FD**: 106 KB → 37 KB smem
  - 40-64 registers/thread per tier; all three tiers instantiate cleanly.

* External call sites updated to pass ``d_workspace``:

  - ``bindings/grim/wrapper_template.cu`` (Python FFI surface)
  - ``test/cuda_equivalents/cuda_equivalence_runner.cu`` (CUDA equivalence harness)

* Composition: FDSVA_SO's device + kernel paths internally compose Minv
  and FD inner. Both call sites updated to pass ``minv_s_F`` (the local
  slot at the start of ``s_temp``) through to the new signatures.

The surgical-spill pattern each of these algos used (split the largest
inner-temp buffer — e.g. Minv's ``s_F`` — into a separate ``s_F`` /
``d_workspace`` parameter, re-base the other offsets to 0, and pick the
placement per tier via ``select_shared_tier_3way``) is the same one the
integrator and idsva_so now follow. See the per-algo ``gen_*`` functions in
``grim_codegen/algorithms/`` for the concrete signatures.

LITE 48 KB smem target — shipped; value tuning remains
-------------------------------------------------------

The machinery this section once described as deferred is **landed**:
``cuda_target_lite_shared_mem_bytes`` (default 48 KB, env-overridable),
``select_shared_tier_3way`` picking a per-tier rung against the SHARED / LITE /
MINIMAL targets, per-tier ``if constexpr`` emission, the ternary
``gen_declare_shared_arena`` arena helper, and the new spill levels that bring
every previously-overflowing h1_2 kernel (IDSVA_SO, FDSVA_SO, END_EFFECTOR_POSE_GRADIENT,
Minv/FD/ABA, and the integrator value+gradient) under the sm_120 cap.

What remains is **tuning, not plumbing**: is 48 KB the right LITE cliff, or
would 32/64 KB fit the real perf curve better? That is a knob to sweep, not a
feature to build — see the deferred validation sweep below.

Remaining inner-plumbing refinement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``idsva_so_body_frame_inner`` / ``idsva_so_world_frame_inner`` now take a
unified ``(s_temp, d_workspace)`` signature and spill per tier (whole-arena at
the deepest rung). The remaining refinement is a *finer-grained* partial spill:
the SO body emitters have heavily-aliased intermediate lifetimes, so keeping
more of the hot band in smem even at MINIMAL needs per-sub-buffer lifetime
analysis. Tracked in ``docs/idsva_so_inner_refactor_notes.md``.

Deferred validation sweep (P7 / P8)
------------------------------------

The tier-system perf characterization is deferred to land alongside
the LITE-48KB and humanoid follow-ups. When that work happens, the
benchmark sweep should produce one comprehensive matrix in a single
run:

**Coverage**

* **GRiM across tiers**: SHARED, LITE (post-48KB-target), MINIMAL.
  Each tier × each algo × each robot.
* **Baselines**:
    - Pinocchio (CPU, cppadcodegen-accelerated, multi-threaded — the
      existing ``baselines/pinocchio/run.py`` harness already drives
      this).
    - Frax CPU + Frax GPU (JAX reference at
      https://github.com/StanfordASL/frax — already wired in
      ``baselines/frax/``; emits ``frax_cpu`` and ``frax_gpu`` columns
      that ``generate_report.py`` knows how to render).
* **Timing modes**: single-call AND multi-call (batch) sweeps. Both
  modes already supported by ``run_multi_version.py`` via
  ``--single-call-iters`` and ``--batch-iters``.
* **Base modes**: fixed AND floating per robot.

**Robustness — collect, don't crash**

The sweep should be failure-tolerant: a single (column × algo × robot
× tier × batch_size) cell failing must NOT abort the script. The goal
is to capture as much data as possible in one overnight run. Each
cell that fails should leave a ``—`` (or NaN) entry in the output
JSON; ``generate_report.py`` already renders missing cells gracefully.

Existing entry points to extend:

* ``test/benchmarks/run_multi_version.py`` — multi-column driver;
  add a ``--tiers perf lite minimal`` argument that fans out the
  GRiM column 3-way. Each tier is a separate run of the GRiM
  harness with the appropriate template-arg-specifying compile flag
  (TIER_SHARED default, TIER_LITE/MINIMAL via a new ``--resource-tier``
  passthrough on the GRiM harness).
* Each cell's ``try`` block in the runner needs to catch all
  ``Exception`` (including ``cudaError`` surfacing as Python
  exceptions, OOM, codegen failures, timeout) and write a placeholder
  entry instead of re-raising.

**Output artifact**

The result lands as a dated, committed snapshot
``test/benchmarks/tier_validation_matrix_<ts>.md`` (e.g.
``tier_validation_matrix_20260523_2200.md``). Same row × column structure as the existing
``benchmark_multi_version_sm120_5090_full.md`` but with GRiM split
into three tier columns (``grim_shared``, ``grim_lite``,
``grim_minimal``).

**Threshold tuning** (the reason this is a sweep, not just
correctness verification):

* Was 48 KB the right LITE smem target? Maybe 64 KB or 32 KB fits
  the actual perf cliff better. Adjust the codegen target.
* Are there ``if constexpr`` branches whose perf cost is too high?
  E.g. on iiwa14 where everything fits SHARED, LITE/MINIMAL aliases
  should be byte-equivalent — verify no regression.
* Pinocchio absolute baseline: GRiM-SHARED / Pinocchio-CPU and
  GRiM-MINIMAL / Pinocchio-CPU ratios. Even at MINIMAL, GRiM on GPU
  should beat Pinocchio CPU for batch ≥ ~16. If MINIMAL drops below
  Pinocchio at small batches, the downgrade design is too aggressive.
* Frax comparison: with GPU acceleration available on both sides,
  GRiM should beat Frax GPU at the dynamics kernels GRiM is
  specialized for (RNEA, FD, gradients, SO). Frax GPU may win on
  end-effector pose (no SIMT specialization). Use this to calibrate
  expectations.
