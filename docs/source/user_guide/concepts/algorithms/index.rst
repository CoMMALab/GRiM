Algorithms
==========

GRiM implements the core rigid-body dynamics algorithms, their analytical
derivatives, and the kinematic, centroidal and trajectory-optimization
operations built on them. Each page gives the algorithm, its Python signature,
where the reference and the CUDA code generator live, and how GRiM exposes it.

Algorithm Overview
------------------

Here's a quick overview of the main algorithms:

* **inverse_dynamics**: Recursive Newton-Euler Algorithm (RNEA).
* **crba**: Composite Rigid Body Algorithm (joint-space mass matrix).
* **aba**: Articulated Body Algorithm (forward dynamics).
* **minv**: Direct Inverse Mass Matrix.
* **Frame Jacobian**: general-frame geometric Jacobian :math:`J` for an
  arbitrary target frame in any of the three Pinocchio reference frames
  (``LOCAL`` / ``WORLD`` / ``LOCAL_WORLD_ALIGNED``), plus the
  Jacobian time-variation :math:`\dot J` and the
  operational-space (OSC) inertia
  :math:`\Lambda = (J M^{-1} J^{\top})^{-1}`.
* **IDSVA-SO**: Second-order Inverse Dynamics Spatial Vector Algorithm,
  with body-frame and world-frame variants and a codegen-time
  dispatcher (body-frame for fixed-base, world-frame for floating-base).
* **FDSVA-SO**: Second-order Forward Dynamics, layered on top of IDSVA-SO
  with a four-tier shared-memory selector for large floating-base
  robots.
* **Kinematics** (:doc:`kinematics`): end-effector pose, its Jacobian and
  Hessian, batched forward kinematics and runtime-selected targets.
* **Integrators and the plant layer** (:doc:`integrators_and_plant`): the
  discrete step, its gradient and Hessian, and the costs and barriers that a
  trajectory optimizer needs.
* **Centroidal & energy** (:doc:`centroidal_and_bias`): CoM (+ Jacobian), CCRBA (:math:`A`, :math:`h`),
  the centroidal derivatives ``dccrba`` (:math:`\partial A/\partial q`) and
  ``cmm_time_variation`` (:math:`\dot A`), the Coriolis matrix
  :math:`C(q,\dot q)`, and the kinetic / potential energy and their
  inertial-parameter regressors. These run on mimic robots, and the
  centroidal derivatives also run on big floating-base robots via the
  sweep-pool spill path.
