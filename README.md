A GPU-accelerated library for robot dynamics, kinematics, and collisions, with analytical derivatives and Hessians for supported numerical operations.

![The GRiM package ecosystem: a user's URDF goes through URDFParser to the code generator (built on GLASS) and RBDReference, producing CUDA C++ with NumPy, JAX, and PyTorch wrappers; benchmarks and tests, backed by pytest-gpu-proof and external oracles, produce validated outputs and performance benchmarks.](docs/imgs/GRiM.png)

GRiM turns a URDF into optimized, per-robot CUDA C++ for rigid-body dynamics, kinematics, their analytical
first- and second-order derivatives and a trajectory-optimization plant layer, then hands you that code three
ways — a numpy handle, a `jax.jit`-able FFI surface, or `torch.autograd`-aware ops — from one content-addressed
`.so` cache. One CUDA block per problem, batched, bit-deterministic and thread-count invariant; the same
model and API rebuild for each target architecture (one artifact per `sm_XX`), with runtime memory
adaptation from embedded Jetson class devices to desktop GPUs. Website: https://a2r-lab.github.io/GRiD/.

GRiM builds on our [URDFParser](https://github.com/A2R-Lab/URDFParser), [RBDReference](https://github.com/A2R-Lab/RBDReference), and [GLASS](https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GLASS) packages (URDF parsing, Pinocchio-validated reference dynamics, and GPU linear algebra), together with its own bundled code generator. Using its scripts, users can easily generate and test optimized rigid body dynamics CUDA C++ code for their URDF files.

Ongoing development and the upcoming rerelease live in [A2R-Lab/GRiD](https://github.com/A2R-Lab/GRiD).
The [original ICRA 2022 paper](https://a2r-lab.org/publication/grid/) describes the
implementation preserved in the archival [robot-acceleration/GRiD](https://github.com/robot-acceleration/GRiD)
repository, not the full feature set or performance of the upcoming release.
See the [project website](https://a2r-lab.org/GRiD/) for the overview. Collision
routines use the generated CUDA interface; numerical Python interface coverage
is documented separately.

**Start-here track:** [`examples/README.md`](examples/README.md) routes the four usage tracks — the [`examples/notebooks/`](examples/notebooks/) Python-bindings tour (01-quickstart → 07-inline-cuda), the runnable [`bindings/examples/`](bindings/examples/) scripts, codegen scripts, and hand-written-CUDA walkthroughs.

**This package contains submodules make sure to run ```git submodule update --init --recursive```** after cloning!

## Quick Start

Install (creates a local venv and registers the `grim-generate` CLI):
```shell
bash install/base_install.sh
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Generate CUDA code for your robot (ten ready-to-use URDFs ship in
`config/robot_assets/` — iiwa14, go2, fr3, g1, h1_2, …):
```shell
# Via the installed CLI (works on a clean base install):
grim-generate config/robot_assets/iiwa14.urdf                # arm, fixed base
grim-generate config/robot_assets/go2.urdf -f                # quadruped, floating base
grim-generate path/to/robot.urdf [-t EE_JOINT_NAME] [-n NAMESPACE] [-f] [--algorithm-list LIST] [-o OUT.cuh]

# Or via a hardcoded zero-config example (these two pull their URDFs from the
# robot_descriptions package — a DEV dependency; install install/requirements-dev.txt first):
python examples/codegen/generate_iiwa14.py       # iiwa14 fixed base
python examples/codegen/generate_go2_floating.py # Go2 floating base
```

Validate and debug:
```shell
# Print CPU reference values for all algorithms:
python examples/codegen/print_reference_values.py path/to/robot.urdf

# Compile and run the CUDA print kernel (requires nvcc):
python examples/codegen/print_grim.py path/to/robot.urdf
```

Write your own CUDA kernel against the generated header:
```shell
# Step-by-step walkthrough + compiling/validated example kernels:
#   examples/cuda/README.md   (and examples/cuda/wrapper_types.md)
bash examples/cuda/build_and_validate.sh   # generate → nvcc → run → validate
```

> **Requires a C++17-capable host compiler** (e.g., g++ ≥ 7, clang++ ≥ 5).
> The benchmark and codegen runtime compile with `-std=c++17` — needed for
> inline variables in the bench common header. With the `[torch]` extra the
> per-robot `.so` follows torch's ATen requirement (`-std=c++20` from torch
> 2.14; needs CUDA 12+ and g++ ≥ 10).

## Usage
+ `grim-generate PATH_TO_URDF` — generate `grim.cuh`; add `-d` for full debug mode, `-f` for floating base, `-t JOINT_NAME` to target a specific end-effector joint
+ `python examples/codegen/print_reference_values.py PATH_TO_URDF` — print CPU reference values for all algorithms to validate CUDA output
+ `python examples/codegen/print_grim.py PATH_TO_URDF` — compile and run the CUDA print kernel against the generated header

## Floating-Base Conventions
Floating-base parsing and the Python reference path now accept a public
floating-base convention flag. The default is Pinocchio-compatible:

+ `floating_base_convention="pinocchio"`:
  `q = [x, y, z, qx, qy, qz, qw]`,
  `v = [vx, vy, vz, wx, wy, wz]`
+ `floating_base_convention="legacy"`:
  `q = [x, y, z, qw, qx, qy, qz]`,
  `v = [wx, wy, wz, vx, vy, vz]`

GRiM normalizes both public conventions into one shared internal floating-base
representation, so the code generator and `RBDReference` stay consistent under
the hood while callers can choose the input/output ordering they need.

## Developer Testing

Contributor-facing test workflows (floating-convention regression suite, CUDA
equivalence env overrides, shared-memory targets) moved to
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#developer-testing); the receipt/verification
policy lives in the
[CUDA validation guide](https://a2r-lab.github.io/GRiD/user_guide/tutorials/cuda_validation.html).


## Current Support
GRiM currently fully supports any robot model consisting of revolute, prismatic, and fixed joints that does not have closed kinematic loops. Arbitrary/skew joint axes (a non-cardinal `<axis>`) are also supported via a dense 6-vector motion subspace — currently for `inverse_dynamics` and `crba` only (cardinal-axis robots stay byte-identical; other algorithms and the helical/planar/spherical joint types are later stages).

GRiM implements the full modern rigid-body-dynamics stack: RNEA / CRBA / ABA /
Minv / forward dynamics; analytical first-order gradients (ID + FD, incl.
external-force gradients); the second-order derivatives (IDSVA-SO both frames
with a codegen-time dispatcher, FDSVA-SO); the kinematics family (EE pose /
Jacobian / Hessian, general-frame `frame_jacobian`/`J̇`/OSC inertia, runtime
multi-EE targets); integrators + integrator gradients; the centroidal family
(CoM, CCRBA, `dccrba`, CMM time-variation, Coriolis matrix, energy/ID
regressors); the inertial-parameter (π) family (the joint-torque regressor
`Y` with its analytic gradient ∂Y/∂(q,v) and the FD parameter gradient
∂q̈/∂π); contact-frame wrench mapping (`contact_fext` /
`register_robot(contact_frames=...)`); runtime tool/payload welding
(`attach_tool`/`tool_fext`); runtime multi-target positions; the collision
family (two-tier `config_free`); a trajectory-optimization `grim_plant`
cost/step layer; and
runtime-mutable inertia/transform/joint-dynamics tables. The **complete
per-algorithm catalog with citations and per-feature detail** lives in the
[CUDA support status page](https://a2r-lab.github.io/GRiD/user_guide/tutorials/cuda_support_status.html).

`RBDReference` additionally provides numpy reference oracles — validated against [Pinocchio](https://github.com/stack-of-tasks/pinocchio) — for generalized gravity, nonlinear effects, kinetic/potential/mechanical energy, the Coriolis matrix, the centroidal quantities (CoM, CoM Jacobian, CCRBA, centroidal momentum) and their derivatives (the analytic `dccrba` ∂A/∂q tensor — replacing the prior finite-difference oracle — and `cmm_time_variation` Ȧ), the inverse-dynamics and kinetic/potential-energy regressors, the general-frame Jacobian / J̇ / OSC inertia described above, and the plant/cost/barrier layer above.

**Dual-surface equivalence.** Every algorithm exists on two surfaces that are tested for numerical agreement: the `RBDReference` numpy implementation (the oracle, checked against Pinocchio) and the generated CUDA C++ kernels (checked against that same numpy reference). This keeps the GPU codegen honest against an independent, Pinocchio-validated baseline.

**Mimic-joint support:** per-robot gating is now essentially eliminated. Non-gradient algorithms (RNEA, forward dynamics, ABA, CRBA, …) work for robots with mimic joints, and every **gradient** emits a correct mimic-reduced result on **both** the fixed and floating base: `inverse_dynamics_gradient`/`forward_dynamics_gradient`, `end_effector_pose_gradient`/`end_effector_pose_hessian`, the second-order `idsva_so`/`fdsva_so`, the external-force gradients (`f_ext_gradient`), and the integrator gradients. The centroidal family — `com`, `ccrba`, `energy`, and the centroidal derivatives `dccrba`/`cmm_time_variation` — now also runs on mimic robots (the per-body Jacobian and per-unit motion columns carry the mimic multiplier α, validated against the mimic-aware reference). `dccrba`/`cmm_time_variation` additionally run on big floating-base robots (e.g. `g1`/`h1_2`-floating) via the sweep-pool spill path. No algorithm raises `NotImplementedError` for mimic robots anymore.

Additional algorithms and features are in development. If you have a particular algorithm or feature in mind please let us know by posting a GitHub issue. We'd also love your collaboration in implementing the Python reference implementation of any algorithm you'd like implemented!

## C++ API
For each algorithm GRiM emits four layers: `*_inner` (core math on
shared-mem inputs), `*_device` (allocates scratch + calls `_inner`),
`*_kernel` (global entry point with batched timestep loop), and the
host wrapper (CPU launcher with H↔D copies). See the
[codegen architecture docs](https://a2r-lab.github.io/GRiD/user_guide/concepts/codegen_architecture.html)
for the rationale and concrete signatures.

## Python API (`grim`)

For Python users the `grim` package (in [`bindings/`](bindings/)) wraps
the per-robot codegen behind a register-then-run UX with `numpy`, `jax`,
and `torch` backends. It ships as part of the single repo distribution — a
`pip install -e .` (what `install/base_install.sh` runs) installs the codegen
toolkit *and* the `grim` wrapper together. The base install is minimal;
pick a backend extra for the surface you want:

```bash
pip install -e "."          # base: numpy backend only
pip install -e ".[jax]"     # + JAX FFI surface
pip install -e ".[torch]"   # + torch backend (CUDA wheel matching your GPU arch)
pip install -e ".[all]"     # jax + torch
```

See the [install matrix in `bindings/README.md`](bindings/README.md#install-editable-from-a-grid-checkout)
for what each extra unlocks (and the torch CUDA-wheel note).

```python
import grim

# numpy (default), jax, or torch; urdf_string= also accepted instead of urdf_path
handle = grim.register_robot("iiwa14", urdf_path="iiwa.urdf", backend="torch")

qdd = handle.forward_dynamics(q, qd, u)   # autograd-aware torch.Tensor
qdd.sum().backward()                      # gradients flow to q, qd, u
```

The `torch` backend exposes autograd-aware `inverse_dynamics` / `forward_dynamics` /
`aba` / `integrator` (analytic backward passes) plus CUDA-Graphs capture,
and the handle also surfaces the `grim_plant` cost/barrier methods. `inverse_dynamics`
(alias `rnea`) / `forward_dynamics` (alias `fd`) take an optional `qdd=` (the
autograd gradient is qdd-aware, returning the correct ∂τ/∂(q,q̇) including the
∂(M·q̈)/∂q term), and all three backends expose the value ops `coriolis_matrix`,
`kinetic_energy_regressor`, `potential_energy_regressor`, `dccrba`, and
`cmm_time_variation` (forward-only on jax/torch). The π-regressor family
(`inverse_dynamics_regressor`, the differentiable
`inverse_dynamics_wrt_params`/`forward_dynamics_wrt_params`, and the
`forward_dynamics_parameter_gradient` ∂q̈/∂π), runtime tool welding
(`attach_tool`/`tool_fext`, via `enable_tool=True`), and multi-contact
wrench mapping (`contact_fext`, via `register_robot(contact_frames=[...])`)
are bound as well. For true fp64 compute build with
`register_robot(..., dtype="float64")` (its own cache entry); `allow_fp64=True`
is only the numpy handle's fp64-in/fp64-out convenience cast on an fp32 build
(ignored when `dtype="float64"`). See
[`bindings/README.md`](bindings/README.md) and the
[Python wrappers docs](https://a2r-lab.github.io/GRiD/user_guide/tutorials/python_wrappers.html).

## Performance
Release measurements from the 27 September 2026 run on one NVIDIA RTX 5090 with an Intel Core Ultra 9 285K cover RNEA,
its analytical gradient (∇RNEA), and its analytical Hessian (∇²RNEA) on iiwa14 (fixed base, 7 velocities), go2
(floating base, 18), and G1 (floating base, 35) at batch sizes 16–1024. The
[release measurements](docs/source/release_measurements.rst) page gives the method, every timing boundary, and the
caveats; the [benchmark harness](test/benchmarks/) reproduces the collection.

![Core-operation speedups against seven baseline modes, with timing boundaries and fp64 exceptions labeled.](docs/source/_static/release/speedup_core.png)

Ratios are baseline time divided by GRiM time; above 1× favors GRiM. Each column names its timing boundary: GRiM host
calls including copies against the CPU libraries, and GRiM compute-only calls against the GPU libraries' resident
calls. `*` marks cells where the evaluated baseline path required fp64 and `~` a side whose run means span more than
1.5×. Colors are clipped at 100×.

![Clustered GRiM, Pinocchio and MuJoCo timing bars on three robots; Hessians compare GRiM with Pinocchio's standard API only.](docs/source/_static/release/stacked_core.png)

Microseconds per complete batch on a log axis. GRiM's bar splits into its CUDA compute-only call, the GPU–CPU I/O
increment, and the JAX wrapper increment. These are differences of measured call times, not isolated measurements of
each component.

![Call wall times for CUDA Device, C++ Host, NumPy, PyTorch, and JAX, in that order, for RNEA, its gradient and its Hessian on three robots; Python bars are solid to the allocate-once call and hatched up to the default call.](docs/source/_static/release/wrappers.png)

Call wall times through each API boundary: native CUDA, the C++ host call, NumPy, PyTorch, and JAX. Pick the
boundary your application uses. For the Python surfaces the solid bar is the call with its buffers allocated once
and reused (measured 2 October 2026), and the hatched cap reaches the default call, which allocates its output every
time. With reused buffers, NumPy and PyTorch land within a few percent of the C++ host call on large outputs.

## Installation
The Quick Start above covers the common-case install. For CUDA Toolkit
setup, developer dependencies (Pinocchio, robot_descriptions, benchmarks),
and Docker, see the full
[installation guide](https://a2r-lab.github.io/GRiD/user_guide/getting_started/installation.html).

## Troubleshooting

### Bench harness `nvcc` hangs on floating-base kernels (sm_8x)

On Ampere (sm_86 / CUDA 12.6) the bench harness can wedge `nvcc` /
`ptxas` at 100 % CPU when compiling heavy floating-base GRiM harnesses.
Pass `--ptxas-opt-level 2` to `test/benchmarks/run_multi_version.py` — it
forwards `-Xptxas -O2` to floating-base compiles only. Blackwell (sm_120) does
not hit this. Typical user code that includes `grim.cuh` and calls the
batch host wrappers (e.g. `grim::forward_dynamics<T>(...)`) does not
trigger the hang — it's specific to the timing-bench template surface.
