"""Structural guard: KERNEL_ATTR_MANIFEST must register EVERY integrator-type
kernel the codegen actually emits.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the TRAPEZOIDAL launch-cliff, 2026-06-18). The integrator
kernels are templated on a non-type `IntegratorType IT` param, so each IT is a
distinct `__global__` instantiation. `init_grim` calls `cudaFuncSetAttribute(...,
cudaFuncAttributeMaxDynamicSharedMemorySize, ...)` once per manifest entry to
raise a kernel's dynamic-shared-memory ceiling above the 48 KB device default.
If an emitted IT is MISSING from the manifest, its attribute is never raised and
launching it with >48 KB of dynamic shared memory fails at runtime with
`cudaErrorInvalidValue` ("invalid argument") — but ONLY at an unspilled tier
(TIER_SHARED) on a robot whose arena exceeds 48 KB, so it slips through the
small/spilled cases. That is exactly how the floating TRAPEZOIDAL gradient kernel
crashed go2-floating at TIER_SHARED while passing at TIER_LITE.

The invariant: for every NON-mjx integrator family in `KERNEL_ATTR_MANIFEST`, the
set of registered `IntegratorType::X` equals the set the codegen emits
(`_INTEGRATOR_TYPES`). This is a pure-Python introspection test (no codegen run,
no nvcc, no GPU) so it runs in ordinary CI and fails the instant someone adds an
integrator type to the codegen without registering its kernel attribute.

(The mjx `mujoco_manifest` is built locally in `gen_init_grimData` with a
DELIBERATELY restricted IT policy — integrator_gradient(mjx) is single-stage
EULER/SI only — so it is intentionally NOT covered by this parity check.)
