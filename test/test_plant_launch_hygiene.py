"""Structural guard: every register-heavy grim_plant kernel launch in the bindings
wrapper must derive its block dimension from ``grim_clamp_threads_for(...)`` (a
``thr`` dim3), NOT a bare ``grim_launch_threads<...>()`` in the launch-config
slot.

WHY THIS EXISTS (the silent register-OOR launch class, 2026-06-19). The plant
cost/step kernels (com_cost, ee_pos_cost, momentum_cost, plant_step,
plant_step_gradient) are register-heavy. Launched at the unclamped global default
thread count, the launch is silently rejected with
``cudaErrorLaunchOutOfResources`` (or ``cudaErrorInvalidValue`` for a >48 KB smem
arena), the kernel never runs, and the device output buffer keeps its stale/zero
contents -- so the binding returns plausible-looking garbage with no error. This
masqueraded as a dozen mjx-vs-oracle failures (com/ee returned 0, plant_step
returned the stale mjx buffer) until ``grim_clamp_threads_for`` + a post-launch
``cudaGetLastError`` were added at every site.

The invariant: for every launch of a register-heavy plant kernel, the thread
argument of the ``<<<grim_dim, THREADS, smem, stream>>>`` config is a clamped
``thr`` (the result of ``grim_clamp_threads_for``), never a bare
``grim_launch_threads<...>()``. Pure-Python source introspection (no codegen,
no nvcc, no GPU) so it runs in ordinary CI and fails the instant a new launch site
(or a regenerated wrapper) drops the clamp.
