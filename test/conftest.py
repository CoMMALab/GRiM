"""GRiM test-suite conftest.

Wires pytest-gpu-proof into the CUDA/wrapper suites without touching every test:
any item already carrying the ``cuda_equivalence`` or ``python_wrappers`` marker
is auto-tagged ``gpu_proof`` so its outcome lands in the signed receipt
(``[tool.gpu_proof] required_marker = "gpu_proof"``). See test/run_gpu_proof.sh.

The plugin now ships from PyPI (``pytest-gpu-proof`` in install/requirements-dev.txt); it
was previously a vendored ``test/pytest-gpu-proof`` submodule.

★ THE SUITE FLOOR (2026-07-14). The GPU suite has 219 `pytest.skip` sites, ~61 of them a per-file
"nvcc not found" / "not in manifest" / "URDF parse failed" guard. Individually reasonable; collectively
they mean that if nvcc falls off PATH or the model manifest breaks, EVERY CUDA test skips, pytest exits
0, and CI is GREEN while nothing was actually tested. There was no floor. This adds one: when the box is
CAPABLE (nvcc on PATH AND a GPU visible), an environment-guard skip is treated as a HARD FAILURE — a
capable box skipping for "nvcc not found" is a real breakage, not an absent environment. On a genuinely
incapable box (no nvcc / no GPU) the guards skip freely, as before. Escape hatch for a deliberate partial
run: `GRIM_TEST_NO_FLOOR=1`.

# XLA's default allocator PREALLOCATES 75% of GPU memory at first backend init
# (24.6 GiB on a 32 GiB card, measured 2026-08-27) — with torch's caching
# allocator on top that was the "accumulation SIGABRT" abort class (~28.0 GiB
# ceiling, re-measured 2026-09-13 under prealloc=ON: guide §7.z9). The old
# mitigation here was PREALLOCATE=false; since the device-pool slab landed
# (GRiM's grimData arena is carved OUT OF XLA's pool — _install_xla_device_pool,
# 2026-09-09) the proper fix is to keep XLA's fast preallocating allocator ON
# but BOUNDED: 35% of a 32 GiB card = 11.2 GiB, comfortably above the measured
# jax working sets (humanoid armD peak 4.2 GiB total process) while leaving
# torch's allocator the rest of the card. Must be set before the first jax
# import anywhere in the process; conftest import is the earliest hook we own.
# setdefault so an explicit caller choice still wins.
