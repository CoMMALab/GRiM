# Generate the signed GPU-proof receipt for GRiM's CUDA + wrapper equivalence
# suites. Run this on a machine with a real GPU and a quiet box.
#
# Receipt SCOPE is tiered so the receipt is never an all-or-nothing barrier —
# the fingerprint + signature + commit-SHA proof are identical regardless of how
# many tests the receipt attests; a smaller scope is a valid (narrower) receipt:
#
#   SCOPE=smoke test/run_gpu_proof.sh     # ~2 robots, cached cells — minutes; proves the plumbing
#   SCOPE=curated test/run_gpu_proof.sh   # representative robot set — tens of minutes
#   SCOPE=full  test/run_gpu_proof.sh     # every gpu_proof test — hours cold, the nightly job (DEFAULT)
#   PYTEST_ARGS="-k go2" test/run_gpu_proof.sh   # ad-hoc scope on top of SCOPE
#
# Ship code first, tighten coverage later: CI verifies whatever receipt is
# committed (and skips if none), so a smoke receipt can land with the code and a
# full receipt can replace it after an overnight run. Re-running just re-signs
# gpu-proof.json in place.
#
# The receipt records outcomes for every test carrying the gpu_proof marker
# (auto-applied to cuda_equivalence + python_wrappers by test/conftest.py) and
# signs the code fingerprint with your local SSH key. CI verifies it CPU-only.
#
# IMPORTANT: pass EXPLICIT test paths, never a bare `pytest test/` — a bare run
# would pick up the CPU-only lane tests that belong in ordinary CI, not the GPU
# receipt. (The plugin is the pytest-gpu-proof PyPI package now, installed via
# install/requirements-dev.txt — no vendored submodule to collect.)
#
# SPLIT=1 — crash-isolated, PAUSABLE receipt path (schema-2 shards), one
# driver invocation covering BOTH suites: python_wrappers as per-module shards
# AND cuda_equivalents as GRANULAR node-id shards bounded to ~2h each (bin-
# packed by test/run_split_suite.py; rolling durations calibrate the packing).
# Everything merges + re-signs into the same repo-root gpu-proof.json the
# monolithic path writes, so CI verify is unchanged.
#   SPLIT=1 test/run_gpu_proof.sh
#   SPLIT=1 SPLIT_RESUME=test/.split_suite/receipt_<stamp> test/run_gpu_proof.sh
#     (continue an interrupted/paused run — completed shards are never re-run)
#   SPLIT=1 SPLIT_CARRY_FROM=old-gpu-proof.json test/run_gpu_proof.sh
#     (carry unchanged modules' shards from an older receipt — verifier accepts
#      carried shards only under a policy with allow_carried: true)
#   SPLIT=1 SPLIT_REFRESH=1 test/run_gpu_proof.sh
#     (the EVERYDAY workflow when CI's verify-receipt goes red: re-run ONLY the
#      shards whose fingerprints changed vs the COMMITTED gpu-proof.json and
#      carry the rest — soundness-gated by codegen_neutrality's covering
#      matrix + robot-asset gate + per-shard header-key replay. Requires a
#      CLEAN tree. GRIM_SPLIT_REFRESH_DRY=1 previews the stale/carried plan.)
# To pause a running SPLIT pass: `touch <out_dir>/PAUSE` (stops cleanly between
# shards, ≤ one shard's latency), or SIGINT/SIGTERM the driver (stops within
# the shard); resume with SPLIT_RESUME.
# SCOPE narrows only the cuda side (via --cuda-k at COLLECTION time — the
# wrapper modules are iiwa14-based without robot names in their test IDs, so a
# robot -k would silently deselect whole modules).
# Verify like CI does — WITH the skip baseline (a local verify without it
# disagrees with CI):
#   gpu-proof verify --receipt gpu-proof.json --policy test/gpu-proof-policy.yaml \
#     --expected-skips test/gpu-proof-expected-skips.txt
# (release: --policy test/gpu-proof-policy-release.yaml refuses carried shards).
