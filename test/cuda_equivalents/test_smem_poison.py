"""Permanent smem-poison regression (the Inc2 audit, wired as a standing gate).

`cuda_equivalence_runner.cu` has an opt-in `GRIM_POISON_SMEM` mode that fills every
SM's dynamic shared memory with NaN (0xFF) BEFORE each algorithm launch. If any
generated device fn reads a caller-carved arena slot before writing it, that NaN
surfaces in the output and fails the golden comparison. `initcheck` is blind to
shared memory and `racecheck` does not flag never-written reads, so this poison
sweep is the only tool that catches the §1j/§1p read-before-write / beta==0-output
class (see docs/agent_debugging_guide.md §1p).

This test re-runs a SMALL slice of the CUDA equivalence suite (one fixed-base + one
floating-base robot, the value-block algo subset, the `zero` sample, one thread count)
with poison ON and asserts it still passes. The value block (inverse/forward dynamics,
minv, crba, aba, end_effector_pose) exercises every caller-carved-arena class while
keeping the header small enough to compile fast — a permanent gate must be cheap. The
FULL sweep (gradients + second-order arenas) is a manual, one-off audit:
`GRIM_POISON_SMEM=1 pytest test/cuda_equivalents/test_cuda_executable_equivalence.py`.

We drive it as a nested pytest (rather than duplicating the fixture-heavy
gen/compile/run/oracle plumbing) so there is exactly one source of truth for the
equivalence machinery. The nested run executes in a temp cwd so its gpu-proof.json
receipt is isolated and never clobbers the parent's.
