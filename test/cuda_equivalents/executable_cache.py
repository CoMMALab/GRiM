"""Content-keyed cache for the CUDA test executables that tests compile themselves.

The flagship runner has its own cache in cuda_harness. The integrator, plant and
second-order runners compile one large generated header each (up to hours for
the humanoids), so they share this one: a per-key lock, a private staging build,
one atomic publication with a manifest, and never a cached failure. Kept out of
cuda_harness so that editing the cache stales only the shards whose modules
import it (see run_split_suite._shard_fingerprint_paths).
