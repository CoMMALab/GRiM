"""Regression sentinel for the shared `gen_matmul` block-wrap modulus.

BUG (fixed 2026-05-31): the shared matmul helper emitted by
`grim_codegen/helpers/_lin_alg_helpers.py:gen_matmul` computed the
per-block base offset as

    int cur = 36*((index/num)%NUM_JOINTS);   # <-- WRONG for mimic robots

For MIMIC robots NUM_BODIES > NUM_JOINTS (mimic joints carry 0 DoF but still
add a body), and `matmul` is called over 36*NUM_BODIES elements by the
idsva_so composite-inertia build (I @ Xup). With the `%NUM_JOINTS` modulus the
LAST mimic body wrapped back to block 0 and multiplied against body-0's
inertia, corrupting that body's composite inertia and propagating the error up
the entire composite-inertia chain -> wrong second-order (idsva_so / fdsva_so)
output. This was caught only by the fr3 second-order comparison.

The fix uses `%NUM_BODIES`. NUM_BODIES == NUM_JOINTS for every non-mimic
fixed-base robot, so the change is byte-identical there; only mimic robots
(fr3, h1_2) are affected.

This is a fast codegen-string sentinel (no nvcc): it would FAIL if the modulus
regressed to `%NUM_JOINTS`. It is scoped to fr3-fixed, where NUM_BODIES (9) and
NUM_JOINTS (8) DIFFER, so the assertion genuinely distinguishes the two forms.
It does NOT duplicate the numeric fr3 second-order equivalence coverage in
`test_cuda_executable_equivalence.py` (which needs nvcc + a GPU and only runs
in the developer CUDA sweep) -- it is the cheap always-runnable guard for THIS
specific layout bug.
