class SplitCell(NamedTuple):
    """One per-algorithm SPLIT cell for the flagship equivalence runner.

    Each cell (a) codegens a SUBSET header (`codegen_algorithm_list` — the algo plus
    the inner deps its kernel calls, so the header is small: ~0.6-1.1 MB vs the 2.4 MB
    all-algo header) and (b) compiles the runner gated to only `run_tokens`
    (`-DGRIM_RUN_SPLIT -D<token>=1`). The result is a ~2-50 s TU that references ONLY
    this algo, so a build break in ANY other algorithm can never void this cell's
    validation (the Bug-A coverage void). `compare_algorithms` is what the harness
    validates vs the oracle for the cell — the q/qd gradient halves share one codegen
    group + RUN token but compare as two named outputs.

    NON-mimic robots use `codegen_algorithm_list` verbatim. Mimic robots (fr3/h1_2)
    IGNORE it and codegen their forced mimic list (one shared header across cells);
    the RUN token still isolates each compile. Dependency GROUPS (confirmed by the
    2026-07-28 cell probe, recorded in the SSOT): forward_dynamics needs
    minv+inverse_dynamics inners; the dynamics gradients need crba (+id) inners on the
    floating path even though the fixed path links standalone."""

# VALUE bug was a shared-arena s_vaf/s_temp UNDER-SIZING for mimic robots. The ID
# inner indexes s_vaf and the I*v scratch by RAW body id (get_num_joints() bodies),
# but the device/kernel wrappers and the inner temp size reserved only
# get_num_pos()-many bodies. For mimic robots get_num_joints() > get_num_pos()
# (mimic joints carry 0 DoF), so the high-body force writes overflowed s_vaf into
# the adjacent s_XImats region, silently corrupting the LOW-jid X matrices (here
# the left leg, root 0). Fixed by sizing s_vaf/s_temp/XImats-scratch by
# get_num_joints() when robot_has_mimic_joints() (byte-identical for non-mimic).
# h1_2 inverse_dynamics / forward_dynamics / aba (and crba/minv/ee_pose)

# A second, related mimic bug was found+fixed in the same pass (2026-05-31): the
# DENSE mimic id_du/fd_du gradient fold called mx<s_ind>_peq_scaled with only the
# mimic multiplier alpha as the scale, DROPPING the joint motion-subspace sign
# s_sign (the helper applies the UNIT axis column, so S = s_sign*e_{s_ind} needs
# alpha*s_sign). Bodies with s_sign=-1 (h1_2's whole LEFT hand: index/middle/
# pinky/ring/thumb mimics + their proximals) got sign-flipped dv/da gradient
# contributions, so id_du/fd_du diverged at those v-slots. fr3's single mimic has
# s_sign=+1 so it was unaffected (alpha*1 == alpha, byte-identical). Fixed the
# four forward mx<s_ind>_peq_scaled calls to scale by alpha*s_sign; the backward
# fxS already carried the sign. h1_2 id_du/fd_du now match pinocchio and are
# UN-GATED. (Non-mimic robots never hit the dense inner -> Gate A unaffected.)
