"""Standalone FLOATING-base VALUE equivalence — isolated from the gradient algos.

WHY THIS EXISTS (Bug A, 2026-06-17): go2-floating `forward_dynamics` VALUE was wrong
(root [angular,linear] vs public [linear,angular] convention) yet hid for a long time.
It hid because the ONLY place that validates floating FD value is the monolithic
`test_cuda_executable_equivalence` per-robot executable — which ALSO compiles
`forward_dynamics_gradient` (needs `crba_inner`). That build died on the missing
`crba_inner`, and the loud build error masked the latent VALUE bug behind it: FD/aba/
minv/ID/crba VALUES for go2/g1/h1_2-floating were never compared.

This test compiles ONLY the value algos (NO gradients) for floating robots, so a build
failure in a gradient algo can never again void validation of the values. It is the
defensive net for the whole floating-root convention bug class (any algo whose floating
qdd/tau/force root 6-vector is mis-ordered shows up here as a mismatch vs RBDReference).

Run (GPU box):
  GRIM_CUDA_FLOATING_VALUE_ROBOTS=go2,g1 \
    .venv/bin/python -m pytest test/cuda_equivalents/test_cuda_floating_values_equivalence.py \
    -m cuda_equivalence -vv
Defaults to the non-mimic floating robots that were masked (go2, g1); override with the
env var. Mimic floating robots (fr3/h1_2) are validated through the monolithic test's
mimic-phase gates and are not duplicated here.
