"""CUDA-equivalence suite conftest: generate PIN-ONLY headers by default.

WHY (2026-07-24). Every test in this directory generates a `grim.cuh` and compiles it
with nvcc. On a floating-base, non-mimic robot the generator also instantiates the mjx
(`MUJOCO_OUTPUT=true`) twin of each kernel -- and those twins are enormous next to their
pin counterparts. Measured on g1-floating:

    idsva_so_world_frame      28.1x        forward/inverse dynamics, minv, crba ~1.0x
    fdsva_so                   4.5x
    inverse_dynamics_gradient  2.9x

~2.1M of the ~2.4M SASS lines in a humanoid build are mjx-only. That cost was being paid
by this suite on every floating cell.

It bought nothing: **no test in this directory exercises mjx.** (Audited 2026-07-24 --
the only `mujoco`/`MUJOCO` hits under `test/cuda_equivalents/` are four comments in .cu
runners; not one runner launches an mjx kernel and not one .py test asserts against the
MuJoCo output convention.) The suite was compiling the expensive half of the library and
then testing the other half. Same worst-of-both-worlds shape as the benchmark harness,
which compiled every mjx twin and never timed one.

So: default this suite to pin-only. Correctness coverage is unchanged, because there was
no mjx coverage to lose.

OPTING BACK IN. Wave B adds real mjx coverage. A test that genuinely exercises mjx must
pass `enable_mujoco_kernels=True` EXPLICITLY to its own `gen_all_code` call -- an explicit
argument always beats the env var, so such a test is self-contained and unaffected by this
file. Do not rely on the env default for mjx coverage; a test that silently generated a
pin-only header would pass vacuously.

    """A4 (2026-09-11): record every generated grim.cuh's CONTENT hash.

    When ``GRIM_HEADER_KEYS_OUT`` names a file (run_split_suite sets it per
    cuda shard under --receipts), append one JSON line per header this shard
    generates or reuses, so the shard's receipt gains a per-cell header
    content-key sidecar. Wave A' consumes these at refresh time: regenerate a
    cell's header CPU-side, compare content hashes, and re-run only the cells
    whose emitted bytes actually rotated (instead of staling the whole cuda
    domain on any codegen edit).

    Two capture layers, both patched from HERE (deliberately not from
    cuda_harness.py — that file is in every cuda shard's fingerprint, so an
    edit there would itself stale the whole domain; this conftest is not):
      - GRiMCodeGenerator.gen_all_code — every DIRECT per-test codegen call
        (the ~26 non-flagship modules), with the bound call kwargs as the
        best-effort recipe evidence;
      - cuda_harness._generate_grim_header — the flagship header path, which
        on a warm cache COPIES the header without calling gen_all_code (the
        layer above would miss cache hits).
    Recording is best-effort by design: a missing record makes Wave A'
    conservatively stale that cell, never silently carry it.
