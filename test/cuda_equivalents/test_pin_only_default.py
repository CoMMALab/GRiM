"""Guards the pin-only default that `conftest.py` establishes for this suite.

`conftest.py` sets `GRIM_ENABLE_MUJOCO_KERNELS=0` so every header generated here is
PIN-ONLY. That is worth ~2.1M of ~2.4M SASS lines on a floating-base humanoid cell, and
it costs no coverage (no test in this directory exercises mjx -- see conftest.py).

The failure mode this catches is silent: delete or break the conftest fixture and every
test here still PASSES, just far slower, while compiling a mjx half nothing asserts
against. Nothing would go red. Hence an explicit assertion on the contract.

Compile-free by construction (no nvcc, no codegen), so it is allowlisted in
`test/test_marker_hygiene.py` and runs even under `-m "not cuda_equivalence"` -- which is
exactly when you want to know the suite's default is intact.
