"""Pin the per-timestep INPUT ABI of the generated header (`h_q_qd_u` / `d_q_qd_u`).

This is a PUBLISHED contract, not an internal detail: consumers that use `grim.cuh`
directly (GATO, MPCGPU, PDDP, any hand-written host code) pack this buffer
themselves, with no Python-side guard to catch a mistake.

The contract
------------
The per-timestep input block is **three NUM_POS-wide slots**::

    stride = Q_QD_U_STRIDE = 3 * NUM_POS          (NUM_JOINTS == NUM_POS)
    q   at  block + 0
    qd  at  block + NUM_POS
    u   at  block + 2*NUM_POS                     (or qdd, for the q|qd|qdd kernels)

On a FIXED base nq == nv, so "three nq-wide slots" and a tight ``q|qd|u`` packing are
the same bytes — which is exactly why a wrong tight assumption can sit unnoticed. On a
quaternion FLOATING base they diverge: nq = nv + 1, so a consumer that packs tightly
writes ``u`` at ``NUM_POS + NUM_VEL`` while every kernel reads it from ``2*NUM_POS``.
Nothing traps that — the read is in-bounds, so the result is silently wrong dynamics.
Floating base is new and about to be adopted downstream, so the ABI is pinned here.

In this raw buffer ``qd``/``u``/``qdd`` occupy **nq**-wide slots: the nv meaningful
values fill the LEADING entries and the trailing entry is a pad. This is internal to
the kernels and the compiled wrapper: every public surface of ``grim`` (NumPy,
JAX, PyTorch, C ABI) takes and returns velocity-like vectors at the nv width and
stages the padded rows itself (2026-09-26 width contract).

These checks are pure codegen text/constants (no GPU): they catch a silently MOVED
offset, which the end-to-end equivalence suite would also catch but only for algorithms
whose floating path is exercised with a non-degenerate ``u``.
