"""FFI-regime autotune for the grim python bindings.

WHY THIS EXISTS (read first): the optimal CUDA block size for a GRiM kernel is
NOT a property of the kernel alone — it depends on the LAUNCH PATH and the
MEASUREMENT (use case). The C++ run.py autotune (-> launch_configs `bases`)
measures the host launch path and bakes a throughput-optimal thread count. The
python bindings launch the SAME kernel through the jax/torch FFI custom-call
path, and for the "batch-to-land" use case (fire ONE batched launch of N, wait
for all N to land — the control/optimization use case) that path has a DIFFERENT
optimum. Measured on iiwa14/fixed/fd/N=256 (lite tier, identical kernel):

    threads   C++ host(us)   jax FFI(us)
      128        15.4           49.7      <- host-optimal; FFI inherits this -> SLOW
      768        (n/a)          30.2      <- FFI-optimal (= lite launch_bounds max)

So a binding that inherits the host's 128 runs fd ~1.6x slow. This tool sweeps
the FFI launch path for the batch-to-land metric and writes the winners into
config/launch_configs/<robot>/<gpu>.json under `ffi_bases` (the host `bases` block is
left untouched). The binding's codegen reads `ffi_bases` by default (profile=
"ffi"; see GRiMCodeGenerator.load_launch_config + bindings/grim/_compile.py),
falling back per-algo to host `bases` for any algo this tool didn't tune.

V1 re-tunes THREADS only (runtime-settable, no rebuild), keeping each algo's
host-autotuned TIER. The mechanism behind the host-vs-FFI thread flip is not yet
explained (sharp FFI cliff at the launch_bounds ceiling) — Nsight profiling is
backlogged. Run this AFTER a C++ autotune (so `bases`/tiers exist) and on the
SAME GPU you deploy on.

--surface picks WHICH python launch path to sweep (each is a different use case
with its own optimum, written to its own launch_configs block):
    jax   -> `ffi_bases`    (jax FFI custom-call, batch-to-land via block_until_ready)
    torch -> `torch_bases`  (torch op path, batch-to-land via torch.cuda.synchronize)
    numpy -> `pybind_bases` (synchronous C-ABI host wrapper, H2D+launch+D2H included
                             — that copy round-trip IS the numpy use case)
The bindings consume these via codegen profile overlays ("ffi"/"torch"/"pybind" ->
<profile>_bases, GRiMCodeGenerator.load_launch_config) and the E6 runtime overlay
(RobotHandle.apply_profile_overlay).

Usage:
    python test/benchmarks/autotune_ffi.py --robot iiwa14 --base fixed
    python test/benchmarks/autotune_ffi.py --robot go2 --base both --n 256
    python test/benchmarks/autotune_ffi.py --robot iiwa14 --surface torch
