"""A1b competitive analysis: GRiM-AUTOTUNED vs each competitor at N=256.

GRiM column = the autotuned best per (robot,base,algo) from autotune_best_<host>.json
  -> 'us' = TOTAL batch_256 COMPUTE-ONLY microseconds at the optimal (tier,threads).
    (the autotune minimizes batch_256_compute_only_us; this is the GPU-resident /
     MPC-rollout number — see project_grim_competitive_analysis.md methodology.)
Competitor column = batch_256_with_mem_us (TOTAL batch us) from each baseline json.
  Same unit (whole-256-batch us), so speedup = competitor_us / grim_us  (>1 => GRiM faster).

This is the apples-to-apples generate_report.py methodology (GRiM compute-only vs
baseline with-mem). It answers: with the FFI/launch thread pathology fixed by the
autotune, which C.7 "losses" are real vs measurement artifacts.

Usage:
