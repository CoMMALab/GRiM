"""Bijection guard: PER_ALGO_SPECS <-> benchmarkable registry keys.

The per-algo bench wrapper dispatches off ``PER_ALGO_SPECS`` (in
``test/benchmarks/baselines/grid/run.py``). If a registry algo has a real
benchmarkable kernel but no spec row, the wrapper silently skips it ("skipping
algos missing a PER_ALGO_SPECS row") and it never gets timed. If a spec row
names a key with no kernel, the bench TU fails to build.

This pins the exact set equality so neither can drift unnoticed. It is the
first cross-check of the "ONE Algo record" -- and permanently closes the
HAS-vs-emission drift class (the same class that produced the f_ext_gradient_dq
null-alloc bug: a key that exists in one table but not the other).
