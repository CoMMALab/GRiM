"""The §1t catch-net: every kernel's launch-sizing macro must COVER what that kernel carves.

WHY THIS EXISTS (docs/agent_debugging_guide.md §1t). A kernel's shared arena is sized from ONE number
-- `<ALGO>_DYNAMIC_SHARED_MEM_BYTES<T,TIER>()`, which the host passes to the launch -- but the arena is
CARVED from a completely independent computation (the t_buffers list + temp_mem_size the emitter hands
`gen_declare_shared_arena`). Nothing tied the two together. When the fdsva_so `idsva_cold` spill rung
applied its saving to the TOTAL instead of inside the `max()`, the macro under-counted by 4308 bytes:
the code compiled clean, passed every fixed-base robot, and then wrote past the end of the arena on
go2-FLOATING only -- taking the whole tier binary down with it (one gpuErrchk exit() kills every algo
in the batch process, so a single wrong `max` silently cost us an entire cell's timing data).

An under-sized arena also DEFEATS the fits-check: `select_shared_tier_3way` asks "does this arena fit in
the smem budget?" using the same under-counted number, so it happily picks TIER_SHARED for a kernel that
does not actually fit.

WHAT THIS CHECKS. Purely static, on the GENERATED header -- no compile, no GPU, no blast radius on
codegen. `gen_declare_shared_arena` already emits every carve as a `// GRIM shared arena layout` comment
block listing each region and its element count. So for every __global__ kernel we sum the regions it
actually carves and assert the macro that sizes its launch is >= that sum, at EVERY tier.

The invariant is `>=`, not `==`: a spill ladder legitimately leaves slack (the arena is a max over rungs,
and the picked rung may not be the argmax). Slack is waste, not corruption. UNDER-counting is corruption.
