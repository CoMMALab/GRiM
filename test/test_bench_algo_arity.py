"""Golden pin for the bench ALGOS arity derivation (H6).

timeGRiM_bindings.ALGOS arities now derive from AbiSpec.inputs. This golden is
the pre-derivation hand table verbatim: a spec-row edit that would change what
the bench feeds an algo fails HERE (loudly, diffably) instead of silently
shifting timing inputs. Update the golden only with a reviewed arity change.
CPU-only.
