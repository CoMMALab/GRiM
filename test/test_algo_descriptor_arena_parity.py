"""Parity + invariant net for the per-algo DESCRIPTOR arena composer (item M, Step 3).

Descriptor-table Step 3 folded the ~272 hand-written `*_t_count` arena expressions in
`GRiMCodeGenerator.gen_add_constants_helpers` into the table: every
`select_shared_tier_3way` site is now DRIVEN from `compose_arena_rungs` /
`compose_arena_full` in `algo_registry.py` (docs/open-tasks/design_descriptor_table_spec.md
§3-4). Step 3.6 deleted the inline `assert composed == legacy` shims + the `_*_legacy`
imperative duplicates — the composer is now the single source of arena logic.

★★ REMOVED 2026-07-14 — `test_arena_full_composer_matches_generator` WAS CIRCULAR AND IS GONE.

It asserted `compose_arena_full(k, ctx) == gen._arena_full_t_counts[k]`. But after the Step-3 fold, 22
of the 34 entries in that snapshot are THEMSELVES assigned from the composer — e.g.
`GRiMCodeGenerator.py` has `"fdsva_so": _fdsva_so_arenas[0]` where
`_fdsva_so_arenas = compose_arena_rungs("fdsva_so", self._arena_ctx)`. So for those keys the test
asserted `compose_arena_full(k) == compose_arena_full(k)`. **It could not fail.**

That is not a hypothetical. It is exactly what happened: the parity net reported GREEN for the entire
life of the §1t bug, while `fdsva_so`'s arena under-counted by 1077 elements and wrote past the end of
shared memory on go2-floating. The fold deleted the `assert composed == legacy` shims but rewired the
"truth" side of the test to the code under test. A green test over an unverified arena is WORSE than no
test — it launders the thing it was built to catch.

★ THE ARENA'S REAL AUTHORITY IS NOW `test/test_shared_arena_covers_carve.py`. That one is genuinely
INDEPENDENT: it compares each kernel's launch-sizing macro against the regions that kernel ACTUALLY
CARVES (parsed out of the emitted header), i.e. two paths that are computed separately and must agree.
Its positive control — re-introducing the bad rung — names `fdsva_so tier 0 short-by-1077` immediately.
**Do not "restore" a composer-vs-generator comparison here. Any such test is a tautology by construction,
because the composer is now the ONLY source of arena logic.**

What remains here are the three checks that are NOT circular — each compares the composer against
something computed independently of it:

  * `test_arena_ladder_invariants` — every composed rung is positive and rung[0] == the full arena
    (structural properties, not a self-comparison).
  * `test_rt_reservation` — the §2 bug-class guard, and the strongest test in this file: it is a
    DIFFERENTIAL check. Compose with `runtime_transform` OFF and ON; every s_temp-domain full arena must
    grow by EXACTLY 36*NJ and every other by 0. The composer cannot satisfy this by agreeing with itself.
  * `test_composed_keys_exclude_only_so_dispatch` — the composed set is exactly the generator's arena
    keys minus the one deferred full (idsva_so_body_frame). A bijection, not a value check.

Matrix (orthogonal axes): iiwa14-fixed (T-only, n==nv), go2-floating (base-DOF terms,
n>nv), fr3-fixed (mimic, NB>nv), + iiwa14-fixed with runtime_transform (the rt_xfixed
term, the §2 bug class). `idsva_so_body_frame`'s FULL stays deferred (its floating path is
a grav_full_spill picker override that is not ctx-pure); its fixed-base rung ladder IS
composed. Pure Python — no nvcc, no GPU.
