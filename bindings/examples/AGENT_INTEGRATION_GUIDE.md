# Integrating GRiM via `grim` — a guide for agents & users

*Last verified against repo state `f0db1a1` (2026-09-18). If the code and this guide disagree, trust the code and fix the guide.*

How to call GRiM's GPU rigid-body dynamics from Python **as effectively as possible**. The
golden rule: **place your data on the GPU once and keep it there.** GRiM is a GPU library;
its speed comes from staying resident across an entire control / learning pipeline, not from
one-shot calls that round-trip to the host.

## The three surfaces — pick by where your data lives

| Handle | Get it with | In / out | Use when |
|--------|-------------|----------|----------|
| **numpy** (base) | `grim.get_robot(name)` / `register_robot(...)` | host `np.ndarray` | scripting, tests, "just give me the answer". Convenience, **not** the speed path — every call is H2D + D2H. |
| **jax** | `grim.jax.get_robot(name)` | device `jax.Array` | JAX pipelines: `jit` / `vmap` / `grad` / `lax.scan`. **The fast path.** |
| **torch** | `grim.torch.get_robot(name)` | CUDA `torch.Tensor` | PyTorch training / MPC; autograd-aware; `capture()` for CUDA-Graphs replay. **The fast path.** |

All three share **one cache** (the same compiled `.so`, keyed by URDF bytes + codegen options +
GRiM version + CUDA arch + wrapper/codegen source hashes — editing grim_codegen or the
wrapper rotates every key; rebuilds are automatic, no force_rebuild needed). Build once, use from any surface. Install is opt-in per backend:
`pip install -e ".[jax]"` / `[torch]` / `[all]` (base is numpy-only). `nvcc` must be on
`PATH` at build time (not at `pip install` time); the per-robot `.so` is built on first use.

## Lifecycle: load_robot / register → precompile → get_robot

**Runtime contexts (W04-B B1).** A handle dispatches to the artifact's *default* context
(`handle.ctx_id == 0`, shared by every handle over the same `.so`). `handle.context()` (numpy,
jax and torch handles alike) gives you an isolated context on the same artifact — its own
arena, tables, streams and launch overrides — closed when that handle closes; `handle.device_profile`
reports what the context was fitted to (device/artifact arch, memory at init, arena bytes, workspace
slots, `max_batch`). Ids are salted per artifact: a foreign or closed id raises a clear error, never a
use-after-free. Details: the *Runtime contexts* concepts page.

**Model versions (W04-B B2).** Runtime-parameter mutations (`set_inertia_params`, `set_transform_params`,
`set_joint_dynamics`, `attach_tool`/`detach_tool`) take the context's admission lock exclusively (ordered
after every admitted call, before every later one) and bump `handle.model_version`. torch/JAX autograd
forwards stamp that version on device at execution time and their backwards refuse a stale stamp
(`model mutated between forward and backward … recompute the forward`) — a jitted `jax.grad` keeps
working across mutations (forward and backward stamp/check inside one execution); only a backward
deferred across a mutation is refused. Launch overrides serialize the same way but do not bump the version.

**Operand validation (W03).** Every input belongs to one operand class (configuration `(B, nq)`, force
`(B, 6*num_bodies)`, plant state `(B, nq+nv)`, plant operands, tool operands, runtime offset, scalars) and each
surface enforces the class rule natively: `1 <= B <= max_batch`, 2D with the exact last dim, every operand
carrying the leading operand's batch, `f_ext` never broadcast. numpy coerces layout/dtype (contiguous copy,
cast); torch refuses CPU / non-contiguous / wrong-dtype tensors; JAX checks in Python first and again in every
FFI handler. Details + the not-checked column: the *Operand validation* concepts page.

Four entry points over the same cache:

| Call | Does | Use when |
|------|------|----------|
| `load_robot(urdf_path, backend=...)` | ZERO-ceremony: derives a stable content-addressed name, builds-if-missing, returns a handle | the frictionless default — no name to invent |
| `register_robot(name, urdf_path, ...)` | build-if-missing **and** return a handle under YOUR name | you want a human-friendly handle name |
| `precompile(name, urdf_path, tiers=..., backends=...)` | build + cache only (no handle) | warm the cache offline (CI / Docker), maybe several tiers/backends |
| `get_robot(name)` | look up an already-registered robot by name | fast start once the cache is warm; raises `RobotNotRegisteredError` if absent, `StaleRobotError` if the cached build is from another wrapper/ABI/arch (rebuild) |

```python
import grim
grim.precompile("iiwa14", "/path/to/iiwa14.urdf",
                    floating_base=False,            # True for free-base humanoids/quadrupeds
                    ee_joint_names=["iiwa_joint_ee"],  # default: all leaf links
                    max_batch_size=1024,            # cap the batch you'll run; bake it in
                    tiers=[{}, {"floating_base": True}],  # prebuild several .so variants
                    backends=("jax", "torch"))      # warm the surfaces you'll use
```

`precompile` is idempotent: a cached tier is an instant no-op (no `nvcc`). The `numpy` backend is
warmed without a handle or a CUDA context (a GPU-less build box works with `cuda_arch=`);
`grim.build_plan(name, urdf, cuda_arch=...)` shows what a build would key on and whether the
cache already holds it, without building. First build of a
small arm is ~30–60 s; large humanoids with second-order kernels take minutes (and lots of RAM).
Ship the cache dir (`grim.default_cache_dir()`, default `~/.cache/grim/` or
`$GRIM_CACHE_DIR`) and every later run starts in well under a second.

- `max_batch_size` is a **compile-time** cap. Calls with `batch ≤ max_batch` run in one launch;
  larger batches must be chunked by the caller. Bake in the largest batch you'll run.
- `urdf_string="<inline URDF>"` works in place of `urdf_path` (cache keys on the bytes, so an
  inline string and the equivalent file dedupe to the same `.so`).
- `algorithm_list=["forward_dynamics", ...]` builds only a **subset** (plus auto-pulled
  dependencies) — big win in nvcc time / RAM / `.so` size for robots with heavy second-order
  kernels. An un-built method raises a clear "add to `algorithm_list` and rebuild" error, never a
  segfault.

## Host arrays (numpy): allocate once, reuse

For the big outputs (`idsva_so` / `fdsva_so`), allocate a page-locked buffer once with
`h.pinned_empty((B, 4*h.num_vel**3))` and pass it as `out=` on every call: the device→host
copy lands in it directly (no extra host memcpy) and the returned tensors are views of it —
~40 ms vs 120 ms per call on g1 @1024 (702 MB), measured 2026-10-01.

`inverse_dynamics_gradient` / `forward_dynamics_gradient` take `out=` as well: allocate
`h.pinned_empty((B, 2*h.num_vel**2))` once; the returned `(B, NV, 2NV)` array is a view of
it (column-major per item, so not C-contiguous) — no per-call allocation, no host re-layout.

## The fast path (JAX): stay resident, compose, differentiate

```python
import jax, jax.numpy as jnp, grim.jax as gj
h = gj.get_robot("iiwa14")                     # JaxRobotHandle; methods return jax.Array
q  = jax.device_put(jnp.asarray(q_np))         # H2D ONCE
qd = jax.device_put(jnp.asarray(qd_np))
u  = jax.device_put(jnp.asarray(u_np))

@jax.jit                                        # fuse GRiM calls + your math into one GPU program
def step(q, qd, u):
    qdd = h.forward_dynamics(q, qd, u)          # FFI call — output never leaves the GPU
    return jnp.mean(qdd**2) + 1e-3*jnp.mean(u**2)

c      = step(q, qd, u)                          # device-resident scalar
g_u    = jax.grad(step, argnums=2)(q, qd, u)     # ANALYTIC gradient via GRiM's custom_vjp
batched = jax.vmap(step)(qb, qdb, ub)            # batch with no Python loop
```

- Every method is a `jax.custom_vjp` over `jax.ffi.ffi_call`: it **composes** under
  `jit`/`vmap`/`grad` and **chains** into the next GRiM call with no host hop.
- Gradients are GRiM's **analytic** Jacobians (a matvec FFI call), not autodiff or
  finite-difference — correct and fast.
- **Resident rollout:** put a GRiM call inside `jax.lax.scan` so a whole K-step MPC/rollout
  horizon is one GPU program and the state is carried device-to-device. See
  [`jax_gpu_resident.py`](jax_gpu_resident.py) for a timed comparison vs the host-roundtrip
  anti-pattern (often 10×+).
- `donate_argnums=` lets XLA reuse an input buffer in place.
- **Need numpy at the end?** `gj.to_host(outputs)` (array or pytree) moves through XLA's
  `pinned_host` memory kind and returns zero-copy numpy views — 41 ms vs 141 ms for
  `jax.device_get` on a 702 MB `idsva_so` output (g1 @1024, measured 2026-10-01).

## The fast path (PyTorch): autograd + CUDA-Graphs

```python
import torch, grim.torch as gt
h = gt.get_robot("iiwa14")                      # TorchRobotHandle; methods return CUDA tensors
qdd = h.forward_dynamics(q, qd, u)              # q,qd,u are cuda tensors → qdd is a cuda tensor
loss = qdd.pow(2).mean(); loss.backward()        # analytic grads flow to q/qd/u

g = h.capture("forward_dynamics", q, qd, u)     # record a CUDA Graph (fixed batch)
out = g(q_new, qd_new, u_new)                    # memcpy-in + replay + memcpy-out (low overhead)
```

`capture()` collapses dozens of per-kernel launches into a single graph replay — a large win
in tight MPC / RL loops where launch overhead dominates. See
[`torch_cuda_graphs.py`](torch_cuda_graphs.py).

**Host round trips, allocate-once style:** `.cpu()` on a big output is a pageable staged copy.
Allocate page-locked mirrors once — `host = gt.pinned_host_like(g.static_out)` — and reuse them:
`g.replay_into(host)` (graph) or `gt.copy_to_host(host, out)` (eager). 39.5 ms vs 238 ms for
`.cpu()` on g1 `idsva_so` @1024 (702 MB), measured 2026-10-01.

## Zero-copy interop (share the GPU pointer)

JAX ↔ PyTorch via dlpack, no copy — the literal device buffer is shared:
```python
t = torch.utils.dlpack.from_dlpack(jax_array)    # JAX → torch
j = jax.dlpack.from_dlpack(torch_tensor.contiguous())   # torch → JAX
```

## Methods (all batched on axis 0; jax/torch are fp32)

`B` = batch, `NJ` = `num_joints` (= `nq`), `NV` = `num_vel` (tangent space). **Fixed base:
`NV == NJ`** and all shapes coincide; floating base: `NJ > NV` (the free-flyer adds a quat slot).

**Dynamics / kinematics** — `inverse_dynamics(q,qd,qdd=None)`→`(B,NJ)` (alias `rnea`; `qdd=None`
gives the bias `c=h−g`, nonzero adds `M·qdd`) · `forward_dynamics(q,qd,u)`→`(B,NJ)` (alias `fd`) ·
`aba(q,qd,u)`→`(B,NJ)` · `crba(q)`→`(B,NV,NV)` · `minv(q)`→`(B,NV,NV)` ·
`end_effector_pose(q)`/`_gradient`/`_hessian` → `(B,6·num_ees[,NV[,NV]])`.

**Derivatives** — `inverse_dynamics_gradient(q,qd,qdd=None)`→`(B,NV,2·NV)` (=`[∂/∂q | ∂/∂qd]`;
qdd-aware) · `forward_dynamics_gradient(q,qd,u)`→`(B,NV,2·NV)` · second-order
`idsva_so(q,qd,qdd)` / `fdsva_so(q,qd,u)` → a `SecondOrderID`/`SecondOrderFD` NamedTuple of
4 × `(B,NV,NV,NV)` tensors (named fields, unpack positionally).

**Trajectory-opt (`grim_plant`)** — `integrator(q,qd,u,dt)`/`_gradient` and
`plant_step(x,u,dt)`→`(B,NX)` / `_gradient`→`(B,2·NV,3·NV)` `[A|B]`, where state `x=[q;qd]`
(`NX=2·NV`). `integrator_type=` is `euler` (default) / `semi_implicit_euler` / `midpoint` /
`rk3` / `rk4`. Cost terms return `(value, grad, hess)`: `quadratic_state_cost(x,x_des,Q)`,
`quadratic_input_cost(u,u_des,R)`, `ee_pos_cost(q,p_des,W)`, `com_cost`, `momentum_cost`; barriers
(`joint_position_barrier`, `joint_velocity_barrier`, `joint_torque_barrier`) return
`(value, grad, hess_diag)`. These are the building blocks for an on-GPU MPC/DDP step.

**Value ops** (all three backends; forward-only on jax/torch): `com`, `ccrba`, `dccrba`,
`cmm_time_variation`, `coriolis_matrix`, `energy`, `generalized_gravity`, `nonlinear_effects`,
`{kinetic,potential}_energy_regressor`, `frame_jacobian`/`_dot` (runtime `target_jid` +
`reference_frame` LOCAL/WORLD/LOCAL_WORLD_ALIGNED), `osc_inertia`, and the runtime-target EE pose
(`end_effector_pose_runtime`, `..._gradient_runtime` — pick any target frame + offset at call
time, one compiled robot serves all).

**π-regressor / tool / contact ops** — `inverse_dynamics_regressor(q,qd,qdd=None)`→`(B,NV,10·NB)`
(the joint-torque regressor `Y`, `tau = Y·π`; all three backends) · differentiable-in-π
`inverse_dynamics_wrt_params(q,qd,params)` (jax/torch; autograd flows `∂c/∂π = Y` to `params`) ·
`forward_dynamics_parameter_gradient(q,qd,u)`→`(B,NV,10·NB)` (jax/torch; `∂q̈/∂π = −M⁻¹Y`) ·
`tool_fext(q, wrench)`→`(B,6·NB)` (world-aligned tool-tip wrench → joint-local `f_ext`; needs
`enable_tool=True`) · `contact_fext(q, f_c)`→`(B,6·NB)` (per-contact-frame wrenches → joint-local
`f_ext`; needs `register_robot(contact_frames=[...])`). The canonical per-backend surface list is
`docs/source/user_guide/tutorials/python_wrappers.rst`.

Properties: `num_joints`, `num_vel`, `num_ees`, `num_bodies`, `floating_base`, `max_batch`,
`output_convention`, plus the unambiguous aliases `nq` / `nv` / `nb` (configuration width /
tangent width / body count).

> **fp32 caveat:** the jax/torch surfaces are **strictly fp32** (compute and I/O). The numpy
> handle defaults to fp32 too but supports a true fp64 tier via `dtype="float64"` (separate `.so`)
> or the legacy `allow_fp64=True` fp32-compute-with-fp64-cast convenience.

## Gradients are analytic

`jax.grad` / `loss.backward()` do **not** autodiff or finite-difference through GRiM — each
differentiable method carries GRiM's own **analytic** Jacobian (a matvec FFI call). On JAX:
`inverse_dynamics`/`forward_dynamics`/`aba`/`end_effector_pose`/`integrator` + the π-regressor VJP
+ `f_ext` parity. On torch: `inverse_dynamics`/`forward_dynamics`/`aba`/`end_effector_pose`/
`integrator` (the rest are forward-only). The `inverse_dynamics` gradient is qdd-aware (includes
the `∂(M·q̈)/∂q` term).

- **Floating base, d/dq:** the kernels' Jacobians live in the Pinocchio free-flyer TANGENT chart
  (`[v_lin local, ω local, joints]`, nv-wide). What `jax.grad`/`q.grad` return is the exact
  pullback to the public `q = [pos, quat_xyzw, joints]` layout of `f ∘ normalize` (the kernels
  evaluate `R(p/|p|)`) — finite differences over every ambient `q` component agree, unit or not.
- **d/dq at a force:** `f_ext` is non-differentiated, but the `q`/`qd` gradients are taken AT the
  force you pass (jax used to silently take the zero-force gradient — fixed 2026-09-19).
- **`f_ext` shape:** `(B, 6*num_bodies)` body-local; jax materializes `(6nb,)`/`(1, 6nb)`
  broadcasts, anything else is rejected (natively too).

## Runtime-mutable model params — sysID / domain-rand / calibration, no recompile

Two opt-in tables let you change the model **after** compile with **no nvcc rebuild** — on ALL
three backends: the jax/torch kernels read the same device-resident table the numpy mutator
pokes, so one `set_*_params` call is seen by every surface over that `.so`:

| Build flag | Mutator | Table shape | Mutates |
|------------|---------|-------------|---------|
| `runtime_inertia=True` | `handle.set_inertia_params(t)` | `(num_bodies, 10)` rows `[m, hx,hy,hz, Ixx,Ixy,Ixz, Iyy,Iyz, Izz]` | spatial inertia in **every** dynamics call (id/fd/aba/crba/minv/gradients) |
| `runtime_transform=True` | `handle.set_transform_params(t)` | `(num_joints, 6)` rows `[x,y,z,roll,pitch,yaw]` (URDF `<origin>`) | each joint's `Xfixed` in the **dynamics** (EE pose still uses the baked origin in v1) | **Dynamics only**: baked end-effector kinematics keep the URDF geometry after a transform update (documented partial capability).

Fetch the baked table from `handle.inertia_params` / `handle.transform_params`, mutate, set it
back. Passing the baked values back is byte-identical to a plain build. Each flag re-keys the
cache (the mutable `.so` coexists with the baked one). This is the entry point for
system-identification, payload changes, domain randomization, and kinematic calibration — see
[`runtime_params.py`](runtime_params.py).

```python
h = grim.register_robot("arm", urdf, runtime_inertia=True)
I = h.inertia_params.copy()           # (num_bodies, 10)
I[-1, 0] += 0.5; I[-1, 1:4] *= ...    # +0.5 kg payload on the last link (scale h=m*c)
h.set_inertia_params(I)               # every later forward_dynamics uses it — no rebuild
```

## Named end-effector targets — pick the EE frame by name

The EE kernels target leaf links by default. To target a specific frame (tool flange, TCP,
sensor), select it by **joint name** — two routes, see [`ee_named_targets.py`](ee_named_targets.py):

- **Baked** (codegen, jittable, all surfaces): `register_robot(..., ee_joint_names=["tool_joint"])`.
  `ee_joint_names` is in the cache key, so distinct targets land in distinct entries. The named
  target now flows through `end_effector_pose` **and** `_gradient` **and** `_hessian` (the
  just-landed gradient/hessian codegen support — not just the value).
- **Runtime** (all backends): one compiled robot, choose the frame **and** an offset point per call:
  `end_effector_pose_runtime(q, ee_joint_names=..., ee_offsets=...)` → `(B, NUM_EE, 6)` and
  `end_effector_pose_gradient_runtime(...)` → `(B, NUM_EE, 6, NV)`. `ee_joint_names` is `None`
  (all leaves) / a name / a list; `ee_offsets` is `None` (origin) / one `[x,y,z]` per frame. Ideal
  for OSC / task-space control where the target or offset changes online.

## Output conventions

Default is **Pinocchio** convention. For MuJoCo/MJX-native I/O (wxyz quat, global-linear free-joint
velocity) use the `.mujoco` view (`h.mujoco.forward_dynamics(...)`), `output_convention="mujoco"`,
or set `handle.output_convention`. It is **floating-base only** (fixed-base, the two coincide) and
a **runtime** setting (not in the cache key — same `.so`). The `.mujoco` view applies the convention
per-call and is thread-safe, so it's safe to mix with pinocchio-convention calls on the same handle.
The **value** methods (id/fd/aba/crba/minv) AND the derivative/second-order surfaces
(`inverse_dynamics_gradient` / `forward_dynamics_gradient` / `idsva_so` / `fdsva_so`) honor
mujoco mode — the mjx kernel twins serve them natively (floating, non-mimic robots built with
`enable_mujoco_kernels=True`, the default). A mimic/skew robot or an
`enable_mujoco_kernels=False` build has no twins and raises a clear error instead.

## Performance: the block size is tuned for *your* launch path + use case

GRiM picks a per-algorithm CUDA block size (threads-per-block) by autotuning. The key thing to
understand: **the optimal block size is not a property of the kernel alone — it depends on the
launch path AND how you use it.** The C++/host autotune optimizes *pipelined throughput*; the
python bindings launch the same kernel through the jax/torch **FFI** path, and for the
**batch-to-land** use case (fire one batched launch of N, wait for all N to land — the control /
trajectory-opt use case) that path has a *different* optimum. On iiwa14 `fd` the host path is
fastest at 128 threads but the FFI path is fastest at ~768 — the same kernel, ~1.6× apart.

- The bindings **ship FFI-tuned defaults** (the `ffi_bases` profile in
  `config/launch_configs/<robot>/<gpu>.json`, baked into the `.so`). You get the FFI-fast path for free
  on the robots/GPUs we tuned (per-algo fallback to the host pick for anything un-tuned).
- **Run the autotune for your own robot / GPU / use case** — there is no single "true" block size:
  ```bash
  python test/benchmarks/autotune_ffi.py --robot <robot> --base both   # writes ffi_bases, then rebuild the binding
  ```
- **Override at runtime** without rebuilding: `handle.set_threads_per_block(n)` forces `n` threads
  for every algo (e.g. to A/B a count, or tune for a non-default batch size). `-1` / default uses
  the baked per-algo config.
- A wrapper call is still a few µs of jax/XLA dispatch slower than the raw kernel even at the best
  block size — that **dispatch tax** is fixed per call, so stay GPU-resident and `jit`/`capture` to
  amortize it (see Do/Don't below). Threads fix the kernel regime; residency fixes the dispatch tax.

Per-algo introspection: `handle.kernel_max_threads(key)` returns the REAL compiled
`__launch_bounds__` ceiling for that algo's baked-tier kernel (keys = the autotune
short names: id, fd, minv, id_du, fd_du, ee_pose, idsva_so, ...; -1 = unknown/absent).
Batch-regime switching (E6): `set_threads_for_n`/`apply_batch_overlay`/`get_batch_switch`
apply per-algo small-batch thread overrides from the config's `ffi_bases_by_n` block.


## Do / Don't

- **Do** `device_put` inputs once and keep outputs as device arrays/tensors across calls.
- **Do** wrap multi-call logic in `@jax.jit` (or `capture()` for torch) so GRiM calls fuse /
  replay instead of dispatching one at a time.
- **Do** set `max_batch_size` to the largest batch you'll run, at build time.
- **Do** match input dtype to the surface: fp32 for jax/torch (an fp64 array forces a copy).
- **Don't** convert to `np.asarray` / `.cpu()` between GRiM calls in a hot loop — that's a
  D2H+H2D round-trip per step and erases the GPU advantage (see the timed anti-pattern in
  `jax_gpu_resident.py`).
- **Don't** rebuild per run — `precompile` once and reuse the cache.
- **Embedding the generated header directly (C++)?** Use the nonterminating
  `init_robotModel_checked` / `init_joint_limits_checked` / `free_robotModel_checked`
  family (or `robotModel_owner<T>`): status-returning, rollback-safe, names the failed
  operation, never `exit()`s or resets the context. The un-suffixed `init_*()` keep the
  historical fail-fast policy. See docs: *Library-safe initialization and cleanup*.
- **Don't** size a batch above `max_batch` (chunk instead) — the error names the compiled
  limit and the `max_batch_size=` knob that raises it.

## Common pitfalls

- **`RobotNotRegisteredError`** from `get_robot` → the cache isn't warm; run `register_robot` /
  `precompile` first (or ship the cache dir).
- **`StaleRobotError`** from `get_robot` → the manifest names a build this `grim` cannot load
  (older wrapper / torch-jax ABI / GPU arch, or a pre-2026-09-22 entry with no build record); re-run
  `register_robot` / `precompile` — byte-identical sources re-hit the store without `nvcc`.
- **"symbol missing" / "not built into this `.so`"** → you used `algorithm_list=` and called a
  method outside the subset; add it and rebuild. Same on all three surfaces.
- **torch "no kernel image available for sm_120"** → the backward VJP runs torch's own CUDA
  kernels, so the installed torch wheel must support the GPU arch (e.g. RTX 5090 / sm_120 needs a
  **cu128+** build; cu124 maxes at sm_90). The GRiM kernels themselves are always nvcc-built for
  the detected arch and are fine.
- **torch `capture()` during stream capture** → `capture()` runs a mandatory off-graph warmup for
  one-time device setup (the >48 KB dynamic-smem opt-in) before recording; don't call methods
  cold inside your own `torch.cuda.graph` context.
- **Big-robot SO builds are heavy** (10s of GB RAM, minutes) — use `algorithm_list=` to build only
  what you need, and prebuild offline.

- [`runtime_params.py`](runtime_params.py) — `set_inertia_params` (runtime_inertia) +
  `set_transform_params` (runtime_transform): sysID / payload / domain-rand / calibration,
  no recompile (numpy).
- [`ee_named_targets.py`](ee_named_targets.py) — named EE frames: baked `ee_joint_names=`
  (value + gradient + hessian) and the runtime `end_effector_pose[_gradient]_runtime` frame/offset.
- [`tool_use.py`](tool_use.py) — weld a rigid tool/payload at RUNTIME (`attach_tool`/`detach_tool`),
  no recompile: payload inertia + a full SE(3) tool-tip frame, attach anywhere, gripping + closed-loop
  recipes, payload-hypothesis sweep.
- [`multi_contact_fext.py`](multi_contact_fext.py) — multi-contact stance forces: register go2 with
  `contact_frames=[four feet]`, map per-foot world-aligned wrenches to joint-local `f_ext` in one
  `contact_fext` call, feed the result to `inverse_dynamics`/`forward_dynamics` as `f_ext=`.
- [`system_identification.py`](system_identification.py) — least-squares inertial-parameter fit with
  the joint-torque regressor (`tau = Y·π`), verified in torque space, pushed back into the running
  model via `set_inertia_params`, plus the differentiable outer loop (`inverse_dynamics_wrt_params`
  under `jax.grad`).

## Welded tools / payloads (`attach_tool`, no recompile)

Register with `enable_tool=True` (turns on the runtime inertia table + runtime contact surface; the
runtime EE surfaces are already in the default build), then:

```python
h = grim.register_robot("arm", urdf_path=..., enable_tool=True)
# a rigid tool = payload inertia on a link + an SE(3) tip frame off that joint:
h.attach_tool("iiwa_joint_7", mass=2.0, com=[0,0,0.08],
              inertia=np.diag([0.02,0.02,0.008]),   # about the payload CoM (optional)
              tip_transform=X_tool)                  # 4x4 SE(3) in the joint frame (optional)
h.inverse_dynamics(q, qd)          # dynamics now carry the tool's weight
h.end_effector_pose_runtime(q)     # defaults to the SE(3) tool-tip frame
h.detach_tool()                    # restore the baked robot
```

- **Attach anywhere** — the first arg is a joint NAME; the tool welds to that joint's child link and
  the tip hangs off that joint. Mid-chain payloads change upstream torques and leave the downstream
  tip untouched. Omit `tip_transform` for a pure carried payload (inertia only).
- **Gripping a tool** — model a firm grasp as a rigid attach on the palm/wrist; you do NOT remove the
  finger DOFs (that would need a recompile). Hold the fingers with `qd=0` (optionally stiff via
  `runtime_joint_dynamics`). Only an *articulated* tool (adds a DOF) needs a rebuild.
- **Tip forces** (grinding, pushing, a second gripper finger) — `h.tool_fext(q, wrench)` maps a
  world-aligned tool-tip wrench `(B, 6)` = `[n_w; f_w]` → a joint-local `f_ext` `(B, 6*num_bodies)`
  you pass straight to `inverse_dynamics(f_ext=...)` / `aba(f_ext=...)`. The `∂/∂f_c` and `∂/∂q`
  derivatives are validated at the device level (`grim::f_ext_body_jacobian_d{fc,q}_runtime_device`)
  for solvers that need the chain-rule term.
- **Two-finger closed-loop grasp** — a tool bridging two fingertips is a closed kinematic loop (not
  representable in a tree). Attach to ONE fingertip + model the other finger's grip as a `tool_fext`
  wrench on the tool tip → an open tree, no closed loop.
- Requires `enable_tool=True`; one tool at a time. Payload composition is additive and
  pinocchio-validated; a null tool is byte-identical to the baked robot.
