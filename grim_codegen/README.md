# grim_codegen — the GRiM code-generation engine

The in-repo Python engine that reads a parsed `robot` (from the `URDFParser`
submodule under `external/`) and emits the per-robot CUDA C++ header
(`grim.cuh`) plus the checked-in generated binding regions. It installs with
the repo's single editable install (`bash install/base_install.sh` — no
separate pip step; new algorithms land here, with their numpy oracle in the
`RBDReference` submodule).

## Usage
```python
from grim_codegen import GRiMCodeGenerator
codegen = GRiMCodeGenerator(robot, DEBUG_MODE=False)
codegen.gen_all_code(output_path="grim.cuh")
```
Or use the `grim-generate` CLI (see the repo README's Quick Start).

## C++ API

**Canonical architecture doc:**
`docs/source/user_guide/concepts/codegen_architecture.rst` — the FOUR-layer
stack (`_inner` / `_device` / `_kernel` / host) and its composition contract.
The one-line version of the three EXTERNAL layers (`_inner` is internal to
`_device`):
+ ```ALGORITHM_device```: the canonical ``__device__`` function. It takes caller-supplied buffer pointers (inputs, outputs, the ``s_temp`` shared scratch pool, and ``d_workspace`` for the spilled tiers) and owns its scratch placement. A single ``if constexpr (!SCRATCH_IN_SMEM) { s_temp = d_workspace; }`` at the top routes the whole pool to global for spilled tiers; every consumer below (XImats helper, sub-inners) inherits the placement. This is what inline-CUDA users embed inside their own kernel.
+ ```ALGORITHM_kernel```: a ``__global__`` entry point that handles batch scheduling (grid-stride loop over timesteps) and global ↔ shared memory transfer. It allocates ``__shared__`` smem for inputs/outputs/``s_temp`` from the per-tier ``*_DYNAMIC_SHARED_MEM_BYTES`` macro and calls ``ALGORITHM_device``. Per-tier dispatch is via the ``RESOURCE_TIER`` template parameter.
+ ```ALGORITHM```: a host function that wraps ``_kernel`` and handles H↔D copies for inputs and outputs.

Internal helpers (``ALGORITHM_inner`` for single-step computational cores, role-specific sub-step helpers like ``fdsva_so_contract``) still exist where useful — they are **internal to ``_device``** and not part of the external surface. Higher-level algorithms call other algorithms' ``_inner`` directly so that one expensive ``XImats`` load is amortized across all sub-algorithms.

Pre-2026 the emitter shipped a fourth, auto-allocating ``_device`` training-wheels wrapper. It was dropped — the only consumer (the equivalence runner) is migrated to allocate smem itself. See ``docs/source/user_guide/concepts/codegen_architecture.rst`` for the rename history.

## Code Generation API

For each algorithm (written as a ```_algorithm.py``` file in the ```algorithms``` folder) the following functions are generally written:
+ ```gen_algorithm_temp_mem_size```: returns a Python number noting the shared memory array size needed for all temporary variables
+ ```gen_algorithm_function_call```: generates a function call for that algorithm and is intended to be used inside other algorithms
+ ```gen_algorithm_inner```: emits the placement-free single-step computational core (called from inside this algorithm's ``_device`` and from composing algorithms). Inputs are already in shared memory; takes ``s_temp`` (already placed).
+ ```gen_algorithm_device```: emits the canonical ``__device__`` orchestrator. Templated on placement flags (``SCRATCH_IN_SMEM`` etc.); owns its ``s_temp`` pool placement via the top-of-body ``if constexpr`` repoint; calls the algorithm's sub-inners (and other algorithms' ``_inner``) to produce the output.
+ ```gen_algorithm_kernel```: emits the ``__global__`` entry point. Allocates ``__shared__`` smem from the per-tier macro, loads inputs, calls ``_device`` with the per-tier flags, writes outputs back.
+ ```gen_algorithm_host```: emits the host function that wraps ``_kernel`` and handles H↔D transfer.
+ ```gen_algorithm```: runs all of the above generators in the right order.

**Codegeneration helper functions are as follows:**

Note: most functions assume inputs are strings and are located in the ```helpers``` folder in the ```_code_generation_helpers.py``` file (and a few are also found in the ```_topology_helpers.py``` and ```_spatial_algebra_helpers.py``` files)

+ Add a string or list of strings of code with ```gen_add_code_line(new_code_line, add_indent_after = False)``` and ```gen_add_code_lines(new_code_lines, add_indent_after = False)```
+ Reduce the global indentation level and insert a close brace with ```gen_add_end_control_flow()``` and ```gen_add_end_function()```
+ Add a Doxygen formatted function description with ```gen_add_func_doc(description string, notes = [], params = [], return_val = None)```
+ Ensure that a block of code is only run by one thread per block ```gen_add_serial_ops(use_thread_group = False)``` and make sure to end this control flow later
+ Run a block of code with N parallel threads or blocks ```gen_add_parallel_loop(var_name, max_val, use_thread_group = False, block_level = False)``` and make sure to end this control flow later
+ Add a thread synchronization point ```gen_add_sync(self, use_thread_group = False)```
+ Test if a variable is or is not in a list ```gen_var_in_list(var_name, option_list)``` ```and gen_var_not_in_list(var_name, option_list)```
+ Generate an if, elif, else statement that can be either non-branching (if only one output variable or the flag is set) or branching selectors for multiple variables at the same time. Variable types, names, and resulting values are defined in the ```select_tuples = [(type, name, values)]``` and are selected when the ```loop_counter``` varaible satisfies the condition set by the ```comparator``` according to each ```count``` in an if, elif, else paradigm. This is done with ```gen_add_multi_threaded_select(loop_counter, comparator, counts, select_tuples, USE_NON_BRANCH_ALWAYS = False)```
+ Load values from global to shared memory (assuming varaibles are called ```s_name``` and ```d_name```) with ```gen_kernel_load_inputs(name, stride, amount, use_thread_group = False, name2 = None, stride2 = 1, amount2 = 1, name3 = None, stride3 = 1, amount3 = 1)```
+ Save values from shared to global memory (assuming varaibles are called ```s_name``` and ```d_name``` or overridden by ```load_from_name```) with ```gen_kernel_save_result(store_to_name, stride, amount, use_thread_group = False, load_from_name = None)```
+ Generate the optimized C++ code string to compute the matrix cross product operation on a set of links/joints ```gen_mx_func_call_for_cpp(inds = None, PEQ_FLAG = False, SCALE_FLAG = False, updated_var_names = None)```
+ **Get** variables that hold C++ code strings that represent the optimized topology pointers for a given set of joint/link indicies for a given robot mode (e.g., either indexing into shared memory to get parent indicies or optimized to simply return the current index minus one for a serial chain roboto) with ```parent_ind, S_ind, dva_col_offset_for_jid, df_col_offset_for_jid, dva_col_offset_for_parent, df_col_offset_for_parent, dva_col_offset_for_jid_p1, df_col_that_is_jid = gen_topology_helpers_pointers_for_cpp(inds = None, updated_var_names = None, NO_GRAD_FLAG = False)``` and similar Python numerical values can be returned through ```dva_cols_per_partial, dva_cols_per_jid, running_sum_dva_cols_per_jid, df_cols_per_partial,  df_cols_per_jid,  running_sum_df_cols_per_jid,  df_col_that_is_jid = gen_topology_sparsity_helpers_python()```

## Additonal Features:
This package also includes test functions which allow for code optimizations and refactorizations to be tested against reference implementations. This code is located in the ```_reference_impl.py``` file.
+ ```(c, v, a, f) = GRiMCodeGenerator.test_rnea(q, qd, qdd = None, GRAVITY = -9.81)```
+ ```Minv = GRiMCodeGenerator.test_minv(q, densify_Minv = False)```
+ ```dc_du = GRiMCodeGenerator.test_rnea_grad(q, qd, qdd = None, GRAVITY = -9.81)``` where ```dc_du = np.hstack((dc_dq,dc_dqd))```

We also include functions that break these algorithms down into there different passes to enable easier testing.

## Binding-surface emission

`abi_specs.py` (ABI_SPECS) drives BOTH generated binding surfaces:
`wrapper_body_gen.py` emits the three checked-in regions of
`bindings/grim/wrapper_template.cu` (C-ABI bodies, kernel_max_threads
branch table, mjx twins; verbatim twin docs in `wrapper_mjx_docs.py`) and
`core_body_gen.py` emits the pybind method bodies + mjx accessors of
`bindings/src/_core.cpp`. Regenerate with `make gen` (or the two
`.venv/bin/python -m grim_codegen.{wrapper,core}_body_gen` commands);
`--check` = the CI drift gates in test/test_{wrapper,core}_generated_block.py.
