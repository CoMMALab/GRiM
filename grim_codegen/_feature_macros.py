"""Feature-macro emission for grim.cuh (the GRIM_HAS_* / GRIM_WITH_MUJOCO wall).

Emits the file-scope preprocessor gates that the binding wrapper's `#if`-guarded
C-ABI bodies key on: second-order availability, integrator availability, the
per-core-algorithm subset-build (rc=3) macros, and the mjx-twins gate. Moved
verbatim out of gen_all_code (C3 fold, 2026-09-08); coverage-gated by
test/test_feature_macro_coverage.py. `gen` is the GRiMCodeGenerator instance;
`algorithms` is the POST-dep-expansion emit set.
